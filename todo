What	Why	How Hard?	Fix

Avoid role checks in layout/app.tsx	Reduces global blocking	Medium	Move logic into per-page hooks or client components

ðŸ”¹ NICE TO HAVE

Tree-shake unused JS	Reduces bundle size	Medium	Use source-map-explorer to find bloated files

Cache static reads with SWR/React Query	Fewer calls, smoother UX	Medium	Wrap contract reads with caching hooks
