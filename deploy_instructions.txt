Summary
Smart Contract: BlockchainClubMembership.sol is now fully optimized, EVM-deployable, and follows best practices (role-based access, pausing, soulbound, voting, whitelisting, etc.).
Test Suite: membership_test_modified.js covers all critical behaviors and passes 100% of tests.
Dependencies: All dependency conflicts are resolved. The project uses Hardhat v2.20+, Ethers v6, and the latest OpenZeppelin and Hardhat plugins.
Deployment: The contract is ready for deployment to Polygon Amoy or any EVM-compatible network.
Frontend: The frontend directory is set up for integration with the deployed contract.

Deployment Instructions (Windows PowerShell)

1. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your project root with:
```
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=RZ4XDWWJSDR2U8DF3SHWF5WC5BDVDZ4UZ5
AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
```
Replace values as needed.

2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Compile the Contract
Compile the smart contracts to generate artifacts:
```
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Deploy to Polygon Amoy
Deploy the contract using the reset-deploy.js script:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/reset-deploy.js --network amoy
```
The script will print the deployed proxy and implementation addresses.

5. Verify Deployment
Verify the contract on Amoy Polygonscan:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-contract.js --network amoy
```
Alternatively, use:
```
npx hardhat verify --network amoy <implementation_address>
```

6. Run the Test Suite
Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass:
```
npx hardhat test
```

7. Integrate with Frontend
Update your frontend configuration with the deployed contract address and ABI:
- Update `frontend/lib/constants.ts` with the new `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `ABI`.
- Test all frontend interactions to ensure compatibility.

8. Run Docker Tasks
To build and run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

- **Build the Docker Image**:
  ```
  npx hardhat run docker-build
  ```

- **Run the Docker Container in Release Mode**:
  ```
  npx hardhat run docker-run: release
  ```

- **Run the Docker Container in Debug Mode**:
  ```
  npx hardhat run docker-run: debug
  ```
