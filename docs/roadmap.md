# Blockchain Club: What We Can Build Next

**Project Ideas & Development Roadmap | July 2025**

---

## Our Vision

We've built an innovative governance system - now let's use it to create real impact. This doc outlines project ideas we can tackle as a club, from humanitarian blockchain initiatives to advanced technical experiments. Think of this as our "what's possible" list.

Remember: Our small team size enables rapid iteration and experimentation, allowing us to build meaningful projects without bureaucratic overhead.

## Project Ideas We Could Build

### **🌍 Humanitarian Blockchain Initiative** 
*Priority: High - Liam wants to launch before graduation*

**The Idea:** Create a blockchain-based system for transparent humanitarian aid distribution or disaster relief coordination. Could be:
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Track donations from source to recipient
- **Identity Verification**: Help displaced populations maintain digital identity
- **Micro-lending Platform**: Small loans for communities in developing regions
- **Educational Credential Verification**: Help refugees prove their qualifications

**What We'd Learn:** Real-world blockchain impact, working with NGOs, scaling challenges, regulatory considerations

**Club Benefits:** Meaningful project for portfolios, potential partnerships with humanitarian orgs, actual social impact

### **🚀 Advanced Multi-Token Logic Experiments**

**The Idea:** Push our dual-layer architecture to its limits with complex token gating:
```typescript
// Example: Semester project access requires multiple credentials
const PROJECT_LEAD_ACCESS = {
  required: ['officer'], 
  plus: ['active_trader', 'github_contributor'],
  temporal: 'current_semester',
  achievement_threshold: 3 // Must have 3+ achievement tokens
};
```

**Innovative Experiments:**
- **Project-Based Tokens**: NFTs for leading specific initiatives
- **Skill Verification**: Tokens for completing trading challenges, coding contributions
- **Cross-Club Collaboration**: Shared tokens with other university blockchain clubs

### **💰 Real Treasury Management**

**The Idea:** Move beyond test networks and manage actual club funds
- Start small: $500-1000 club budget managed on-chain
- DeFi yield farming with educational focus
- Transparent expense tracking for club activities
- Member dividend distributions based on participation

**Learning Outcomes:** Real DeFi experience, risk management, institutional compliance

### **🎓 Cross-University Network**

**The Idea:** Connect with other university blockchain clubs
- Shared governance protocols between schools
- Inter-university competitions with blockchain verification
- Collaborative research projects
- Guest speaker coordination via DAO

### **📱 Mobile-First Governance App**

**The Idea:** Make our governance system actually usable for students
- Mobile app for voting, proposal creation, treasury monitoring
- Push notifications for governance events
- QR code-based NFT verification for in-person events
- Social features: club member directory, skill sharing

## Technical Experiments to Try

### **Governance Innovation:**
```typescript
// Progressive voting: Recent activity boosts voting power
const calculateVotingPower = (member) => {
  let base = getTokenVotingPower(member.tokens);
  let activityMultiplier = getRecentActivity(member, 30); // Last 30 days
  let achievementBonus = getAchievementTokens(member).length * 0.1;
  
  return base * (1 + activityMultiplier + achievementBonus);
};
```

### **Social Coordination:**
- **Project Formation DAO**: Members propose projects, others join with skills
- **Reputation Staking**: Stake tokens on project success predictions
- **Skill Exchange Marketplace**: Trade teaching time for tokens

### **Real-World Integration:**
- **University ID Verification**: Link student IDs to wallet addresses
- **Academic Credit Integration**: Blockchain certificates for independent study
- **Career Services**: Verifiable internship and project experience

## Why This Matters

We're not just building a governance system - we're creating a model for how student organizations can operate in the digital age. Every project we ship, every experiment we try, every problem we solve becomes a blueprint for other clubs, other schools, other communities.

Plus, these experiences look impressive on resumes and provide real blockchain development experience that most students never get.

**Most importantly:** We're proving that small teams can build meaningful, impactful technology when they have the right tools and governance structures.
