# Technical Specification

This document describes the contract architecture and internal logic for the Blockchain Club membership system. It is intended for developers, auditors, and contributors seeking a clear overview of how the smart contracts operate.

---

## Overview

The system uses modular, upgradeable smart contracts to handle:

- NFT-based role assignment (membership tokens)
- Role management (Admin / Officer / Member)
- Escrowed treasury functions (ETH, ERC20, NFT)

All contracts follow the UUPS proxy upgrade standard and enforce granular access control through `AccessControlEnumerable`.

---

## Contracts

### 1. `BlockchainClubMembership.sol`

ERC721-based membership tokenization protocol with hierarchical access control and comprehensive governance mechanisms.

**Protocol Features:**
- ERC721Enumerable with UUPS upgradeability pattern
- Hash-based token type identification system
- Temporal minting constraints with configurable access windows
- Soulbound token enforcement for governance-critical NFTs
- Configurable metadata architecture with base URI management
- Automated role assignment integration with `Roles.sol`

**Core Functions:**
- `mint(to, tokenType, isSoulbound)` â€“ Officer-authorized token issuance
- `publicMint(tokenType, isSoulbound)` â€“ Public minting with access validation
- `requestWhitelist()` â€“ Permissioned onboarding request system
- `processWhitelistRequest(requestId, approve)` â€“ Officer-mediated approval workflow
- `createTokenType(...)` â€“ Token type configuration and deployment
- `burnToken(tokenId)` â€“ Officer-authorized token destruction
- `setBaseURI()` â€“ Admin-controlled metadata URI management
- `initialize(name, symbol, rolesAddr)` â€“ Proxy initialization with role integration

**Security Model:**
- Admin-restricted upgrade authorization and metadata control
- Officer-gated token operations and whitelist management
- Token type configuration determines public access parameters
- Comprehensive reentrancy protection on state modifications

---

### 2. `Roles.sol`

Hierarchical access control protocol implementing OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlEnumerable` with voting power distribution.

**Role Hierarchy:**
- `ADMIN_ROLE` â€“ Protocol-level privileges (contract upgrades, voting power configuration)
- `OFFICER_ROLE` â€“ Operational authority (token operations, whitelist governance)
- `MEMBER_ROLE` â€“ Base membership tier with governance participation

**Voting Power Distribution:**
- Officer tier: 5x voting weight multiplier (configurable)
- Member tier: 1x base voting weight (configurable) 
- Individual voting power overrides supported per address

**Core Functions:**
- `grantRole(role, account)` / `revokeRole(role, account)` â€“ Role assignment operations
- `grantRoleBatch(role, accounts)` / `revokeRoleBatch(role, accounts)` â€“ Batch role operations
- `hasRole(role, account)` â€“ Role verification queries
- `getVotingPower(account)` â€“ Effective voting weight calculation
- `getUserCurrentRole(account)` â€“ Highest role identification
- `setVotingPower(role, power)` â€“ Admin-controlled role-based voting configuration
- `setCustomVotingPower(account, power)` â€“ Admin-controlled individual voting overrides

---

### 3. `TreasuryRouter.sol`

Time-delayed multi-asset management protocol supporting ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 transfers with comprehensive security mechanisms.

**Protocol Architecture:**
- 24-hour temporal security lock on all asset transfers
- Multi-asset support: ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 NFTs
- Separated deposit and execution phases for security validation
- Comprehensive metadata tracking for audit trails
- Emergency administrative controls for protocol security
- Batch execution optimization for gas efficiency

**Core Functions:**
- `receiveFunds()` / `receiveFundsWithMeta(metadata)` â€“ ETH deposit operations
- `depositERC20(token, amount, metadata)` â€“ ERC20 token deposit protocol
- `depositNFT(token, tokenId, metadata)` â€“ NFT deposit and custody
- `executeTransferBatch(transferIds)` â€“ Batch ETH transfer execution
- `executeERC20TransferBatch(transferIds)` â€“ Batch token transfer execution
- `executeNFTTransferBatch(transferIds)` â€“ Batch NFT transfer execution
- `cancelERC20Transfer(transferId, reason)` / `cancelNFTTransfer(transferId, reason)` â€“ Administrative cancellation
- `updateTreasury(newTreasury)` â€“ Treasury address reconfiguration
- `emergencyWithdraw()` â€“ Emergency protocol controls
- `setTreasury(address)` â€“ Treasury recipient configuration (Gnosis Safe recommended)

**Escrow Execution Flow:**
1. Officer initiates asset deposit with metadata
2. Transfer queued with temporal lock and comprehensive tracking
3. 24-hour security window enforced before execution eligibility
4. Administrative cancellation authority prior to execution

## Performance Analysis

**Gas Optimization:**
- Contract deployment costs optimized for production use
- All contracts remain under 24KB size limit for mainnet deployment
- Function execution costs analyzed and documented

ðŸ“Š [Detailed gas analysis](../analysis/gas-analysis.md)

**Code Quality:**
- Comprehensive static analysis via Solhint
- Security patterns validated
- Best practices enforced across codebase

ðŸ“‹ [Code quality report](../analysis/code-quality.md)

---

## Upgradeability & Administrative Controls

- UUPS upgradeability pattern implementation across all contracts
- `ADMIN_ROLE` maintains exclusive upgrade authorization
- Production upgrades require multisig or Gnosis Safe execution

---

## Deployment Protocol

- Proxy initialization via `initialize()` functions (UUPS pattern compliance)
- Deployment sequence requirements:
  1. `Roles.sol` â€“ Base access control deployment
  2. `BlockchainClubMembership.sol` â€“ NFT system with roles integration
  3. `TreasuryRouter.sol` â€“ Asset management with membership verification

---

## Protocol Considerations

- Temporal constraints utilize `block.timestamp`; edge case scenarios require monitoring
- Off-chain whitelist synchronization requires state consistency with smart contract storage
- ERC721 tokens implement soulbound functionality when flagged during minting (transfer restrictions)

---

## Implementation Status

This specification documents the production version deployed on Polygon Amoy testnet. Mainnet deployment scheduled following comprehensive frontend integration and external security audit completion.
