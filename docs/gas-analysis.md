# Gas Analysis & Performance Report

## Contract Deployment Costs

Based on Hardhat contract sizer analysis with Solidity 0.8.20 and optimizer enabled (200 runs):

| Contract | Deployed Size | Initcode Size | Status |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **BlockchainClubMembership** | 22.77 KiB | 22.84 KiB | ‚úÖ Under 24KB limit |
| **TreasuryRouter** | 14.53 KiB | 14.60 KiB | ‚úÖ Optimized |
| **Roles** | 6.71 KiB | 6.78 KiB | ‚úÖ Lightweight |

## Performance Analysis

### üéØ **Deployment Optimization**
- All contracts remain **under the 24KB deployment limit**
- Optimizer enabled with 200 runs for production efficiency
- ModulAr design keeps individual contracts lightweight

### ‚ö° **Gas Efficiency**
- **BlockchainClubMembership**: Largest contract at 22.77 KiB (92% of limit)
- **TreasuryRouter**: Mid-size at 14.53 KiB with complex multi-asset logic
- **Roles**: Minimal overhead at 6.71 KiB for access control

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security vs Performance**
- Comprehensive access control adds ~6.7 KiB overhead
- Multi-asset treasury support requires ~14.5 KiB
- NFT membership with metadata uses ~22.8 KiB
- **Total system**: Well-optimized for feature richness

## Recommendations

‚úÖ **Production Ready**: All contracts deployable on mainnet  
‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: Optimized gas usage for club operations  
‚úÖ **Scalable**: Room for future feature additions within limits
