**Blockchain & Crypto Investing Club: Technical Whitepaper**

**Version 1.0 | July 2025**

---

### Key Judgments

* This club represents a student-led implementation of on-chain governance, role-based access, and treasury control using smart contracts.
* The system operates entirely on decentralized infrastructure, increasing transparency, accountability, and operational resilience.
* Membership is verified via soulbound NFTs, governance is tiered and programmable, and treasury funds are protected by a 24-hour escrow and role-gated authorization.
* The project is positioned as a functional prototype for decentralized academic organizations.

---

## 1. Introduction

The Blockchain & Crypto Investing Club exists to bridge the gap between theoretical education and practical blockchain application. It offers members hands-on access to smart contract operations, DeFi integration, and capital management using a fully on-chain infrastructure.

This whitepaper provides a formal overview of the system's architecture, governance logic, and operational objectives. The audience includes developers, student leaders, auditors, and academic partners.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Challenges in Traditional Student Organizations:**

* Decision-making and financial operations lack transparency.
* Member contributions are not verifiable or formally recognized.
* Investment experience is typically simulated, not real.
* Leadership transitions risk continuity and institutional memory.

**Limitations of Web2 Infrastructure:**

* Spreadsheets, forms, and manual tracking introduce friction.
* Permission management is fragmented across apps.
* Record-keeping is non-portable and unauditable.

**Assessment:**
On-chain infrastructure offers verifiable record-keeping, automated access control, programmable governance, and tamper-resistant operational memory. This club applies these principles in a student governance context.

## 3. System Overview

**Core Components:**

* **Roles.sol**: Permission hub that defines tiered access and stores voting weights.
* **BlockchainClubMembership.sol**: Manages token-gated membership using non-transferable (soulbound) NFTs.
* **TreasuryRouter.sol**: Handles treasury operations with time-locked fund releases.

**Network:** Polygon was selected for low fees and EVM compatibility. Contracts are upgradeable using the UUPS proxy pattern.

## 4. Governance Model

### Current Tiered Roles:

* **Admin**

  * Upgrades contracts
  * Appoints new officers
  * Manages treasury routing
* **Officer**

  * Creates token types
  * Mints memberships
  * Manages whitelists
* **Member**

  * Holds NFTs
  * Participates in governance

### Voting Power:

* Stored on-chain in `Roles.sol`
* Officers receive 5x voting weight by default
* Members receive 1x weight
* Custom overrides supported

### Future Governance Phases:

1. **Snapshot Integration** — Token-weighted off-chain voting (Q3 2025)
2. **On-Chain DAO** — Proposal execution and treasury authority (Q4 2025)
3. **Full Autonomy** — Multi-institution DAO governance (2026)

---

## 5. Membership System

**NFT-Based Verification:**

* Minted via `BlockchainClubMembership.sol`
* Token types configured with:

  * Start/end dates
  * Supply caps
  * Whitelist/public/officer-only access
* Soulbound (non-transferable) flag supported per token ID

**Automatic Role Sync:**

* Officers minting tokens can assign roles in real time
* Member statistics recorded on-chain

**Use Cases:**

* Gate access to internal platforms
* Verify alumni and contributors
* Track tenure, participation, and token history

---

## 6. Treasury Operations

**Fund Routing:**

* Handled by `TreasuryRouter.sol`
* Deposits held for 24 hours before release
* Only authorized roles can update destination addresses

**Security Model:**

* Delay window prevents immediate fund extraction
* Emergency withdrawal enabled with role-gated control

**Future DAO Integration:**

* Voting contract will authorize releases
* Spend proposals will trigger programmable transfers

---

## 7. Technical Summary

**Upgradeability:** UUPS pattern with access control enforced via `onlyRole(ADMIN)`

**Token Structs:** Each NFT type stores config in `TokenTypeConfig` struct

**Role Storage:** AccessControl used with custom `roleVotingPower` and `customVotingPower`

**Mint Logic:** Officer gating, public mint windows, and soulbound enforcement built-in

**Escrow Delay:** `RELEASE_DELAY = 24 hours` ensures review period on all deposits

---

## 8. Outlook

We assess with high confidence that on-chain student organizations will increase in number and importance. This model offers a blueprint for transparent, secure, and educationally rich club operations.

Immediate priorities:

* Finalize Snapshot strategy integration
* Deploy production contracts to Polygon mainnet
* Launch proposal system and token-gated tools

Long-term objectives:

* Expand to partner universities
* Implement cross-chain DAO tooling
* Secure formal audit and institutional backing
