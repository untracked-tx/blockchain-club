The Humanitarian and Economic Problem
Cross-border remittances are a lifeline for hundreds of millions in developing countries, often exceeding foreign aid and investment in scaleworldbank.org. In 2023, low- and middle-income nations received an estimated $669 billion in remittancesworldbank.org, supporting basic needs like food, housing, and education for families. Research shows these flows directly reduce poverty: a 10% increase in remittances per capita is associated with about a 3.5% decline in the share of people living in povertyblogs.worldbank.org. In countries like Uganda, Bangladesh, and Ghana, remittances have cut national poverty headcounts by several percentage pointsblogs.worldbank.org. Clearly, enabling remittances means boosting welfare and resilience in vulnerable communities.
Despite their importance, sending money home remains costly and inaccessible for many. Global transfer fees average 6.2% on a $200 remittance, over twice the UN Sustainable Development Goal target of 3%worldbank.org. Sub-Saharan Africa endures the highest costs – about 8.4% on average in mid-2024africa.businessinsider.com – due to limited competition and reliance on costly intermediaries. Traditional banks are the most expensive channel (around 12% fee) while digital and mobile-based methods are cheaper (4–5%)worldbank.org. High fees mean less money reaching families and more strain on household budgets. Additionally, many migrants resort to informal hawala networks or carry cash, which can pose security risks and lack transparency.
Just as significant are the “last-mile” barriers for recipients. A large share of remittance beneficiaries are unbanked, lack smartphones, or live in remote areas with sparse financial infrastructure. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, lack of a mobile phone is the second-most common reason people cannot use mobile money servicesworldbank.org. Likewise, absence of formal ID or bank accounts prevents many from receiving funds directlyworldbank.org. As a result, people often depend on intermediaries and agents to access money. About 14% of unbanked adults in Africa say they have someone else (family, friends, or an agent) transact on their behalf, obviating the need for their own accountworldbank.org. In Tanzania, fully 30% of unbanked individuals use an intermediary to make or receive paymentsworldbank.org. This highlights both a coping mechanism and a point of friction: those without digital access must trust others and often pay extra for basic transactions. The gap in access is also gendered and rural – women and remote communities are especially likely to be unconnected and excluded from formal financial systemsworldbank.orgbcg.com.
These challenges are even more acute in humanitarian contexts such as conflict zones or disaster areas. Displaced people and crisis-affected populations often lack documentation, smartphones, and bank accounts, making it hard to receive aid through traditional banking. During emergencies, aid agencies have historically delivered help as physical cash or paper vouchers – methods that are logistically slow, expensive, and prone to leakage. For instance, coordinating cash distributions in disaster zones can take weeks and incur significant security and handling costs. There is a clear need for solutions that can move value quickly, transparently, and directly to people in need, without requiring recipients to navigate complex banking setups. The goal is to lower transaction costs (thus stretching each dollar of aid or remittance further) and boost financial inclusion by reaching people who have only basic phones or no internet access.

Protocol Solution: Walletless Claims, Agent Mesh, and Stablecoin Settlement
To address these issues, we propose a walletless, agent-based crypto protocol that delivers digital cash vouchers backed by stablecoins. The solution is designed for environments with limited connectivity and low smartphone penetration, leveraging simple codes and local human networks rather than user-managed crypto wallets. Its key components are: (1) walletless claim codes for users, (2) a mesh of community agents facilitating exchange, and (3) stablecoin-based settlement on a blockchain.
Walletless claim codes act as one-time digital vouchers representing a specific value. Instead of requiring the recipient to install a crypto wallet or remember private keys, the system generates a unique code (e.g. numeric PIN or alphanumeric voucher) for each remittance or aid disbursement. This claim code can be delivered via SMS, printed on paper, or even communicated verbally if needed. It serves as a bearer instrument – whoever presents the correct code can redeem the associated funds. Because the underlying funds are held on a blockchain, the codes are effectively non-custodial vouchers: the money is locked in a smart contract until the code is redeemed, rather than being held by an intermediary. This preserves security and transparency without burdening end-users with managing cryptographic wallets. A similar concept was tested by World Vision’s Sikka platform, where beneficiaries’ mobile numbers were used as identifiers and tokens (pegged to aid commodities) were sent via SMS as e-vouchersifrc.org. Whenever a user made a transaction through SMS, a blockchain transfer was triggered and confirmed back to them by textifrc.org. These examples show that it is feasible to link simple codes/phone numbers to blockchain value transfer in low-tech settings.
The agent mesh refers to a distributed network of local agents, merchants, or community volunteers who interface between the digital system and the physical cash economy. These agents play a role analogous to mobile money agents or hawala brokers – they are the human ATMs providing cash-in and cash-out services. In our protocol, agents would register with the program and be equipped with a basic smartphone app or even just an SMS interface to the system. They are able to verify and redeem voucher codes on behalf of users. For example, when a beneficiary in a village presents their claim code, the agent uses the app/USSD menu to validate it with the blockchain backend. Once validated, the agent hands over the corresponding amount in local currency (or goods, if the agent is a shopkeeper and the voucher is meant for purchases). The agent in turn receives the equivalent value in stablecoin deposited to their account or wallet. Agents are incentivized by small commissions on each transaction or by a favorable exchange rate margin. This model builds on the proven success of agent networks in mobile money: studies find that cash-in/cash-out agents are critical for reaching unbanked populations, as they provide the bridge from physical cash to digital valuebcg.com. As long as transaction volumes are healthy, agent fees can sustain the network and even turn a profit, motivating agents to serve remote or low-income communitiesbcg.com. Our protocol’s design ensures that local entrepreneurs (shop owners, postal outlets, microfinance reps, etc.) have a business case to participate, which in turn expands coverage in areas lacking banks.
Using stablecoins for settlement provides a secure and inflation-resistant medium of value transfer. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the US Dollar – for example, USD Coin (USDC) or similar tokens. Pegged stablecoins eliminate the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ensuring that $50 sent is $50 received. They also enable seamless currency conversion: a sender’s dollars can be transmitted as stablecoin and a recipient can cash out in local currency without costly forex conversions. In this protocol, when a sender or aid organization funds a remittance, their fiat money is converted to stablecoin on the blockchain network. The stablecoin is then locked in a smart contract until redemption. This approach has been validated in recent humanitarian pilots – for instance, the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) delivered assistance in Ukraine by sending USDC (a dollar-pegged stablecoin) over the Stellar blockchain, which recipients could hold in a digital wallet and later cash out via MoneyGram locationsunhcr.org. By using a decentralized stablecoin rail, UNHCR achieved fast, direct cash delivery with full traceability and no intermediaries skimming feesunhcr.orgstellar.org. Our protocol similarly leverages stablecoins to reduce dependence on correspondent banks and money transfer operators, potentially cutting transfer fees substantially. A well-designed blockchain remittance can route money for a fraction of traditional costscointelegraph.com, especially if integrated with local mobile money or fintech channels (which average ~4% fees, lower than banksworldbank.org).
In summary, the solution offers a “last-mile digital cash” system optimized for inclusion. A sender (or aid donor) provides funds that are tokenized as stablecoins on a blockchain. Instead of the recipient needing any app or account, a voucher code is issued to them as the placeholder of that value. A network of nearby agents and vendors – who do have connectivity or a wallet – serves as the touchpoint for the recipient to redeem the voucher for actual cash or goods. The blockchain smart contracts ensure that when a code is redeemed, the stablecoin value moves transparently to the redeeming agent. This combines the trust and speed of blockchain with the approachability of community-based finance. The user experience is similar to receiving a mobile airtime top-up or a prepaid voucher: easy and familiar, even on basic phones. Meanwhile, the backbone ledger provides global interoperability and auditability. Multiple projects in emerging markets mirror aspects of this design: for example, Kotani Pay in Kenya enables users to send or convert crypto via simple USSD short codes, without requiring internet or smartphonescryptoaltruism.org. By dialing a code, users access a menu to move funds between a blockchain wallet and mobile money, all hidden behind a user-friendly interfacecryptoaltruism.org. This shows that non-custodial crypto services can be wrapped in SMS/USSD interfaces that feel like familiar mobile banking. Our protocol expands on these ideas with a focus on remittances and aid, using one-time claim codes that can be widely distributed (even on paper if needed) and a robust agent network to handle localization.

Smart Contract Architecture (Functional Design)
The core of the system is a set of smart contracts that manage voucher issuance, redemption, and fund flows in a secure and transparent manner. While the technical implementation can vary by blockchain platform, the functional architecture can be described in broad terms:

Stablecoin Escrow Contract: This contract holds the pool of stablecoin funds that have been deposited for remittances or aid distribution. When a sender or NGO deposits, the contract locks the amount on-chain and associates it with a newly generated voucher code (or a hash of it). Each voucher code corresponds to a specific value (e.g. 100 USD in stablecoin) reserved in the escrow. The code itself can be generated off-chain for security (to avoid revealing it on the public ledger) but a secure hash or identifier is stored in the contract state to mark a valid claim. The contract might emit an event or reference number that the sender shares with the recipient as their claim token.
Voucher Issuance Mechanism: A backend service or on-chain function creates vouchers upon request. For example, an aid organization’s dashboard could call a contract function like issueVoucher(recipient_id, amount) which in turn locks the amount and returns a unique code. Importantly, this code is not tied to a private key or digital wallet – it is more like a bearer coupon. The issuance can also encode conditions such as expiry date (after which unclaimed funds revert to the sender or pool) or usage restriction (e.g. only redeemable at certain vendors, if desired for aid programs). In functional terms, the system ensures double-spend prevention – once a voucher code is generated, it cannot be reused or altered, and once redeemed it cannot be redeemed again. This could be achieved by marking each code as redeemed in the contract state when a claim occurs.
Redemption Contract: When an agent or authorized party receives a code from a user, they will invoke a redemption function (directly via a mobile app calling a blockchain API, or indirectly via an SMS gateway server). For instance, redeemVoucher(code) would check the submitted code against the stored hash or record on-chain. If valid and unused, the contract transfers the corresponding stablecoin amount to the agent’s blockchain address (which is provided along with the code in the transaction). The contract then marks the voucher as redeemed (burns the record or flags it). Because this process is on a public ledger, it creates an auditable trail – stakeholders can see when and where each voucher was redeemed, without necessarily knowing the personal identity of the end-user (only the agent’s address and a voucher ID). No central party can intercept or fake the redemption because the contract enforces cryptographic verification of the code. This non-custodial redemption means that even the platform operator cannot divert the funds – only possession of the correct voucher code allows a claim, and the payout goes directly to the redeemer’s address.
Agent Registry and Roles: The system may include a registry of trusted agent addresses or a role-based access control in the contracts. For example, during agent onboarding, each agent could be assigned a blockchain address or account which is whitelisted to redeem vouchers. This adds a layer of security: if desired, vouchers could be made only redeemable by registered agents (so if a code leaked, an unregistered party couldn’t steal it, since they wouldn’t have a whitelisted address to claim). Alternatively, the system might allow open redemption (any address that knows the code can redeem) for simplicity, which is closer to cash – this would require user education to keep codes secret until presenting to an authorized agent. In practice, a registry approach is useful in aid programs where specific vendors are contracted to accept the vouchers. It is less critical for personal remittances where the sender entrusts the code only to the intended beneficiary.
Value Transfer and Conversion: The architecture needs to bridge between stablecoins and local fiat currency. In many cases, agents will want to convert the received stablecoins into local money to replenish their cash on hand. This can be handled through liquidity providers or integration with existing financial infrastructure. For example, the agent app might automatically swap the stablecoins to mobile money credits or bank deposits using an API, or agents can periodically sell their accumulated stablecoins to a liquidity partner (such as a crypto exchange or aggregator) in exchange for cash. The smart contract could also be linked with a decentralized exchange or an automated market maker to facilitate in-protocol conversion to local currency tokens if those exist. In functional terms, however, these conversions can be abstracted away from the user experience – the key is that the smart contract ensures a full reserve of stablecoin backing all vouchers at all times, and that when redemption happens, the value is reliably delivered to the redeemer. By using a widely adopted stablecoin, we inherit the broad acceptance and liquidity of that token (e.g. an agent might directly accept USDC because they know they can trade it for USD or local currency easily).
Security and Privacy: The contracts must be designed with security best practices. Voucher codes should be sufficiently complex (high entropy) to prevent guessing or brute force. If hashes of codes are stored on-chain, they should use secure one-way hashing (so even if the ledger is public, one cannot derive the code). The system should also handle replays or errors – e.g. if an SMS delivery is delayed, or a user accidentally shares a code publicly – with procedures to cancel and reissue vouchers when needed (possibly by voiding the old code on-chain and allocating a new one). Privacy is maintained by not storing personal data on-chain; instead, anonymous voucher IDs or phone number hashes can be used. As noted by humanitarian blockchain research, it's possible to use anonymous identifiers (like phone numbers or beneficiary IDs) without exposing names or sensitive data on the ledgerinnovation.wfp.org. This ensures compliance with data protection while still enabling tracking of transactions for auditing.
From the user’s perspective, these smart contract operations are invisible – they experience only the issuance of a code and its later redemption. But under the hood, this architecture guarantees that funds are safe, traceable, and automated. The use of smart contracts means reduced reliance on manual reconciliation: every redemption is final and recorded, eliminating ambiguity about whether a voucher was honored. It also opens up possibilities for programmatic features: for instance, a contract could automatically distribute a pool of funds into N vouchers of certain values (useful for aid agencies doing bulk disbursements), or enforce rules like “this voucher cannot be redeemed before date X” (to schedule aid waves). The system therefore combines the flexibility of software (if policies need to change, contracts can be upgraded or parameters tweaked) with the integrity of blockchain (tamper-proof execution).

Real-World User Flows and Agent Incentives
User Journey – Remittance Scenario: Consider a migrant worker who wants to send money to family back home in a rural village. They visit a participating remittance agent or use a mobile app in the sending country. The sender provides the amount (say $100) in cash or via a bank transfer to the service. The agent or app then triggers the crypto protocol to create a voucher worth $100 (minus a small fee) in stablecoin. A unique claim code (for example, a 12-digit number) is generated and given to the sender. The sender passes this code to their family by whatever means is convenient – often simply a text message or a phone call.
On the recipient side, the family member now has a code but perhaps only a basic phone. They go to the nearest local agent in the network – this could be a shopkeeper or existing mobile money agent who is part of the program. The recipient presents the code (e.g. shows the SMS or reads the number). The agent then uses their interface to validate it. This could be a special SMS syntax or a menu on their phone (USSD) that allows the agent to enter the code and their own PIN. For example, the agent might dial something like *123# on their phone, bringing up a menu, select "Redeem voucher", and enter the code. The system (via the smart contract or an API) checks the code’s validity. If everything is in order, the contract releases the $100 in stablecoin to that agent’s crypto wallet address immediately. The agent then hands over the equivalent in local currency cash to the recipient (after deducting any predefined fee). The user walks away with their money, no smartphone or bank account needed – just as if they received cash from a money transfer shop, but without the multi-hour bus ride or high service charge.
From the sender’s perspective, the process is near-instant and likely cheaper. Rather than paying, say, a $10 fee via a traditional service, they might pay a few dollars or less, which covers the blockchain transaction fee and agent commission. From the agent’s perspective, they have performed a service (paying out cash) and in return now hold $100 in stablecoin in their digital wallet. The agent can accumulate such stablecoins and periodically cash them out – for instance, by selling them to a liquidity provider for local currency, or using them to offset the next remittance someone sends in the opposite direction. In many corridors, flows can be two-way (though usually one predominant direction); an agent might also do cash-in for users who want to buy vouchers to send out. The agent’s role is essentially like that of Western Union’s local payout partners, but here they interact with a decentralized system and earn a share of fees directly.
User Journey – Humanitarian Aid Scenario: An international NGO working in a disaster-hit region needs to distribute emergency cash assistance to 5,000 displaced families. Many of these beneficiaries have lost their IDs and phones, and are sheltering in areas with patchy connectivity. The NGO uses our protocol to streamline the distribution. First, they onboard local merchants and relief volunteers as agents – for example, small shop owners in the camps, or staff at relief centers – explaining how to redeem vouchers and ensuring they have either a smartphone or a basic phone to use for verification. Next, the NGO allocates, say, $50 per family in aid, and the system generates 5,000 unique voucher codes each representing $50 in stablecoin. These codes are printed as scratch-off cards or QR code coupons, or delivered by SMS where possible. During the distribution day, families receive their code (on paper or via text). Beneficiaries can then go to a participating shop (perhaps a local food store) and use the voucher to purchase needed supplies. At the shop, the merchant scans the QR code on the paper (if using a smartphone app) or keys in the number on their USSD menu. The $50 stablecoin is instantly transferred to the merchant’s account via the blockchain, and simultaneously the system logs that voucher as redeemed. The merchant gives the family $50 worth of goods (or cash, if the program allows cash-out). This approach was piloted by Oxfam in the South Pacific: they provided disaster-affected households with tap-and-pay NFC cards preloaded with e-voucher value, and local vendors were given a smartphone app to accept paymentsoxfam.org. The result was a 96% reduction in delivery time for aid and drastically lower overhead costs compared to traditional methodsoxfam.org. Beneficiaries could receive assistance in hours rather than weeks, and Oxfam reported 75% lower distribution costs while achieving 96% user satisfactionoxfam.org. Our protocol’s flow is very similar, with the difference that we emphasize an open stablecoin system and potentially use SMS codes instead of NFC, making it even more accessible in places without smartphones.
Agent Incentive Model: For the agent mesh to be sustainable, agents must be adequately compensated and motivated. The protocol builds this in through transaction fees and value-added services. Every time an agent redeems a voucher, they earn a commission. This can be structured in a few ways. One simple model: the voucher could include a built-in fee that is paid to the agent’s wallet alongside the principal amount. For instance, a $100 remittance might actually transfer $101 in stablecoin to the agent – $100 for the beneficiary payout and $1 (1%) as the agent’s fee (funded by the sender as part of the service fee). Alternatively, the agent could charge the recipient a small cash-out fee. The exact model may depend on local regulations (some countries might cap how much can be charged to recipients). Regardless, the system should target a low fee split between senders and agents that still beats the status quo (for example, 3-4% total cost, of which a portion goes to the local agent). This aligns incentives: agents have a revenue stream for each transaction, encouraging them to serve more customers and even promote the service, while users still pay much less than they would for traditional remittances.
In addition to direct fees, ancillary benefits encourage agents. Because the protocol can reach people who were previously excluded, it brings new customers to agents’ businesses. A small shop that becomes a voucher agent might see increased foot traffic, and beneficiaries may spend some of their aid money at that shop (just as mobile money agents often see business benefits from offering financial services). Furthermore, the transparency of the blockchain can build trust – agents know they will reliably receive their funds when they perform a redemption, since the smart contract guarantees settlement (no risk of a central company delaying reimbursement). In large-scale programs, one could also introduce a reputation or reward system: for example, agents who consistently cover remote villages or operate during emergencies could receive performance bonuses, or even governance tokens if the platform is community-owned. Blockchain enables creative incentive schemes; however, even without complex tokenomics, the basic commission model is sufficient as evidenced by mobile money networks. Boston Consulting Group’s analysis has shown that agent networks become viable and even profitable in rural areas when transaction volumes reach a critical mass and agents earn fees that cover their costs with some marginbcg.com. The mesh network should focus on building volume (through many senders and aid programs using the system) so that agents handle enough transactions per week to make it worthwhile to maintain liquidity.
User Protection and UX: The flows are designed to be as user-friendly as possible. For recipients, using a code with a local, trusted agent mirrors familiar processes (many already use phone recharge codes or mobile money PINs). There will be an emphasis on literacy and security training: users are instructed to keep their voucher code confidential and report if lost or stolen (the NGO or provider could then invalidate that voucher on-chain before misuse). If a beneficiary does lose their code, the system can require a simple identity check by the agent (like an ID card or a recorded name) before redemption, to mitigate fraud – these operational safeguards would be defined per project. Importantly, because no smartphone or complex onboarding is needed, even marginalized groups (elderly, women in purdah, people in remote villages) can participate equally. They just need to receive a small piece of paper or SMS. The use of SMS/USSD has already been successfully demonstrated in programs like Grassroots Economics’ Sarafu network, where users join a blockchain-based community currency by dialing a short code and setting a PIN, linking their phone number to an accounttreasuryxl.comtreasuryxl.com. In that case, every user indeed has a blockchain address and private key under the hood, but all actions (check balance, send tokens) are done via simple USSD menus on feature phonestreasuryxl.com. Our walletless voucher system goes one step further in ease-of-use (not even requiring an account setup for one-time use), but could evolve into such an account-based model as users become more comfortable.

Supporting Evidence from Academia and Field Pilots
There is a growing body of research and real-world case studies that underpin the need for and the design of this walletless, agent-based crypto system. Below is a summary of key evidence from development economics, humanitarian operations, and blockchain implementations that support our approach:

Impact of Remittances on Development: Academic studies and multilateral institutions have documented how vital remittances are for economic development and financial inclusion. Remittances not only raise household incomes but can nudge recipients into the formal financial system. For example, studies in Nepal found that remittance-receiving households were more likely to open bank or mobile accounts, especially when transfer services partnered with local financial institutionsaeaweb.org. More broadly, as mentioned, cross-country analyses by the World Bank and IMF confirm remittances significantly reduce poverty rates and improve indicators like school enrollment and health spending in receiving familiesblogs.worldbank.org. However, high transaction costs (globally averaging 6-8%) act like a regressive tax on these flowsworldbank.orgafrica.businessinsider.com. Reducing fees via technology (e.g. digital and crypto channels) could thus amplify the poverty-reduction impact. Our protocol, by leveraging low-cost digital rails and local agents, aligns with G20 and UN advocacy to cut remittance costs and increase financial inclusion.
Barriers to Access – Need for Offline Solutions: Surveys of financial inclusion point to the lack of phones, IDs, and digital skills as persistent barriers, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asiaworldbank.org. The Global Findex 2021 data highlights that millions remain unbanked not by choice but due to structural issues – low connectivity, documentation hurdles, and reliance on intermediariesworldbank.org. Humanitarian research similarly notes that in many refugee or conflict settings, beneficiaries cannot be reached through smartphone apps; thus, innovations must incorporate offline or analog components. A Cambridge analysis on digital assets for humanitarian cash transfers emphasizes using basic mobile channels and even paper-based barcodes as offline authentication mechanisms for aid distributionifrc.orgifrc.org. Our design directly addresses these constraints by utilizing SMS, USSD, and paper vouchers as delivery channels. The success of projects like Machankura – which enabled Bitcoin transactions via USSD for users in multiple African countries – demonstrates that even without internet, people can send and receive digital value using simple GSM codeshackernoon.comhackernoon.com. Machankura integrated with voucher services (Azteco) allowing offline redemption of crypto by entering a printed voucher’s reference number on a basic phonehackernoon.com. This real-world use of vouchers and USSD in crypto is a strong proof-of-concept for our approach.
Humanitarian Blockchain Pilots: Several humanitarian organizations have already piloted blockchain-based cash and voucher assistance (CVA) programs, yielding promising results. The World Food Programme’s Building Blocks project is the largest example – it uses a private blockchain to manage food assistance for refugees. Since 2017, Building Blocks has processed over $325 million in aid for more than 1 million refugees in Jordan, Bangladesh, Lebanon, and Ukraineinnovation.wfp.orginnovation.wfp.org. By eliminating duplicative banking intermediaries, WFP saved approximately $3.5 million in financial fees to dateinnovation.wfp.org. In Jordan alone, using blockchain e-vouchers (authenticated by biometric iris scans at shops) saved WFP about $2.4 million in transaction costs, money that was redirected to feed additional familiesinnovation.wfp.org. These savings underscore how much traditional payment channels were siphoning in fees – blockchain streamlined the process and kept more funds in the system for beneficiaries. Oxfam’s UnBlocked Cash pilot in Vanuatu (mentioned earlier) similarly found that a blockchain voucher system could cut distribution costs by 75% and delivery time by 96%, while greatly enhancing transparencyoxfam.org. The transparency came from real-time transaction monitoring: NGOs could see every payment as it happened on the platformoxfam.org, reducing fraud and improving accountability. Another case, UN Women in refugee camps, combined with WFP to distribute cash-for-work payments via blockchain and reportedly achieved a 98% reduction in financial transaction costs by using a shared ledger instead of traditional e-card providerssciencedirect.com.
Vouchers and Digital Cash in Crisis Response: Beyond cost, blockchain-based vouchers improve access and resilience in crises. In environments like refugee camps or war zones, banking infrastructure can be unreliable or biased. The UNHCR’s recent pilot in Ukraine leveraged the Stellar blockchain to send aid in USDC directly to refugees’ phone-based walletsunhcr.org. Over 2,500 households received aid this way in the pilot phase, totaling $4.6 million disbursed, with full traceability of funds usagestellar.org. Beneficiaries could cash out at MoneyGram locations or hold the digital dollars as savings in a volatile environmentunhcr.org. The program was so successful that UNHCR is scaling it up and even extending it to other regions (like a refugee aid program in Argentina), highlighting the versatility of stablecoin solutionsstellar.org. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, NGOs have explored using crypto vouchers for last-mile cash delivery when sanctions and banking shutdowns impeded traditional aid – a pilot with HesabPay and a local NGO delivered digital cash aid to rural communities via mobile app in 2022, showing promise in reaching women who couldn’t travel to banks (as reported by the pilot team in mediamedium.com). These pilots collectively show that blockchain systems can operate in low-trust, low-infrastructure settings and actually improve the speed and reach of aid.
Community Currency and Agent-Led Crypto: Our protocol’s agent-based model is inspired by successful community-driven digital currency projects. One example is the Sarafu Community Inclusion Currency in Kenya. Grassroots Economics (the NGO behind Sarafu) transitioned what used to be paper vouchers into a blockchain token system that runs on feature phonestreasuryxl.comtreasuryxl.com. Individuals join by dialing a USSD code and are given an initial balance of community creditstreasuryxl.comtreasuryxl.com. They trade these via SMS with local businesses, and the entire system functions without smartphones by piggybacking on the mobile network. Each Sarafu user indeed has a blockchain address and private key, but by securing it behind a PIN and using phone numbers as proxies, the experience feels like a simple mobile money wallettreasuryxl.comtreasuryxl.com. This project has reached tens of thousands of users, and even the Kenyan Red Cross embraced it to distribute aid in 2020-2021, recognizing that community vouchers can be an effective alternative to cash transferstreasuryxl.com. Another example, Kotani Pay, works with refugee camps in East Africa to provide a USSD interface for crypto transactionscryptoaltruism.org. Refugees in Kenyan camps were able to receive a basic income in crypto (cUSD on Celo) and convert it to M-Pesa via Kotani’s systemnewsandviews.vilcap.comemergingbrandafrica.com. These initiatives provide on-ground validation that the unbanked and underserved can be reached with blockchain-based value transfer, as long as the user interface is simplified (USSD, vouchers) and an agent or integration exists to handle the fiat conversion. Our proposed protocol synthesizes lessons from these projects: use stable, known-value tokens, design for offline access, and empower a network of local agents or businesses to act as the human face of the system.
In summary, both scholarly research and practical pilots support the notion that a walletless, agent-mediated crypto system can dramatically lower costs and expand inclusion. Remittances are made cheaper and more accessible, and humanitarian aid can reach more people faster. Key patterns observed include the importance of trust (users trust local agents and the known mobile channels), the need for low-tech options (SMS, paper), and the benefits of transparency (all transactions traceable, reducing leakage). These findings inform the design and implementation roadmap of our solution.

Use Cases and Pilot Deployment Roadmap
The walletless remittance and aid protocol can be applied across various high-need corridors and crisis contexts. Below we outline several concrete use cases and a phased roadmap to pilot and scale the solution:
1. High-Volume Remittance Corridors with Barriers: A prime target is corridors where remittance volumes are large but recipients face access hurdles. For example, the Gulf States to South Asia corridor (millions of migrant workers sending to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal) is ripe for innovation. Many rural households in South Asia receiving funds do not have formal bank accounts, and women in conservative areas may not travel to distant banks. A pilot could be launched for Nepali migrants in the UAE: a Nepali worker in Dubai purchases a $200 voucher through a participating exchange bureau; the family in rural Nepal gets an SMS code and redeems at a local cooperative or mobile money agent. This could piggyback on existing mobile money infrastructure in Nepal (which has decent penetration) and demonstrate cost savings relative to traditional transfers (currently, sending money to South Asia costs ~5-7% in fees). Another high-volume example is North America to Latin America – e.g. the U.S. to Guatemala or Honduras. Indigenous and rural communities in Central America often lack banking, so relatives rely on expensive cash pick-up services. A pilot in Guatemala could work with microfinance institutions as agent outlets, distributing stablecoin-backed vouchers that recipients redeem for quetzals. Given that Mexico and the Philippines are among the top remittance recipients globallyworldbank.org, later phases could extend to those countries as well (leveraging their growing fintech ecosystems to integrate agent networks).
2. Fragile States and Conflict Zones: Remittances to countries like Somalia, Yemen, and Syria are critically important (often exceeding 20% of GDPafrica.businessinsider.com), but formal channels are limited due to sanctions or weak banking sectors. Somalia, for instance, relies on hawala and mobile money for 90%+ of incoming remittancestrade.gov. A pilot here could collaborate with a Somali telecom operator: diaspora funds are turned into stablecoin vouchers that family back home redeem as mobile money credit via an USSD code. This would test the integration of crypto rails with an existing mobile money agent network (Somalia’s Hormuud or Golis networks). Similarly, in Yemen or Syria, aid organizations could distribute relief funds as claim codes. Local money exchangers or shopkeepers (who are already de facto financial service providers in these contexts) would serve as redemption agents. Such a pilot must be sensitive to regulatory issues (e.g. ensuring compliance with sanctions by whitelisting authorized aid recipients), but if successful, it can ensure families in war-torn regions get help faster and more safely than carrying cash across checkpoints. Notably, the International Committee of the Red Cross and IFRC have been examining blockchain and digital identity solutions to maintain aid delivery in conflict zones – for example, the Sikka project was considered for Iraq and Myanmar pilots to allow refugees to access aid via simple mobile vouchersifrc.orgifrc.org. Our approach would extend these ideas into a full remittance ecosystem.
3. Humanitarian Cash Assistance Programs: Beyond individual remittances, the protocol can transform how humanitarian agencies deploy cash-based assistance in disasters. A near-term use case is natural disaster response in the Pacific or Caribbean, where small island states often receive emergency funds after cyclones or earthquakes. Instead of flying in banknotes or setting up expensive cash distribution logistics, agencies can issue digital vouchers to affected households. Local retailers (pre-registered as aid vendors) can redeem the vouchers when selling relief goods. The Oxfam Vanuatu project already validated this approach for a Pacific cycloneoxfam.org. A next step is to coordinate among multiple NGOs and governments to use a common voucher system in such scenarios, improving inter-agency interoperability. The roadmap could involve a multi-agency pilot in a controlled setting – for example, a refugee camp in East Africa. Partners like WFP, UNHCR, and a few NGOs could jointly adopt the protocol to give assistance to different needs (food, shelter, cash-for-work) through one voucher wallet per family. Building Blocks in Jordan provided a blueprint, where 100+ thousand refugees received various types of aid from different orgs via one blockchain-based accountinnovation.wfp.orginnovation.wfp.org. Our system could replicate that in a more decentralized fashion, using phone-number-linked vouchers rather than biometric cards, and thereby lowering entry barriers for smaller NGOs to participate (no expensive biometric systems needed – just SMS).
4. Domestic Transfers and Financial Inclusion: While the focus is cross-border, the protocol could also boost domestic financial inclusion. In countries with mobile money, the same voucher mechanism can enable government-to-person payments (G2P) or NGO-to-person payments in underserved areas. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments struggled to send stimulus or aid to informal workers quickly. A system of SMS claim codes redeemable at mobile money agents could expedite such disbursements. A pilot could be trialed for a social protection program in a country like Kenya or Ghana, where mobile money agents are widespread but reaching the last-mile in rural villages is still challenging. By using a blockchain voucher that multiple banks or NGOs can fund, it avoids duplicative platforms and creates a more open ecosystem for cash transfers.
Roadmap for Pilot Deployment:

Phase 1: Lab Prototype and Stakeholder Alignment. In this initial phase (3-6 months), build a working prototype of the smart contracts and a simple SMS/web interface in a controlled environment. Engage key stakeholders – money transfer operators, NGO cash specialists, telcos, and local agent network managers – to refine requirements. Conduct user focus groups with migrants and rural recipients to ensure the voucher format and redemption process are understood and trusted. Parallelly, sort out regulatory aspects: obtain any necessary waivers or sandbox approvals for using stablecoins in the chosen pilot corridor, and ensure KYC/AML compliance frameworks for agent enrollment (e.g. agents might need to be existing licensed money service businesses or registered merchants in their locale).
Phase 2: Small-Scale Pilot in One Corridor. Select a high-impact corridor or community for a live pilot (e.g. 500–1000 transactions). For instance, implement in Kenya–Uganda cross-border remittances between migrant communities, or a pilot between a diaspora group in one city and a village cluster back home. During this phase, train a handful of agents (maybe 5-10) on using the system, and distribute vouchers to a test user group. Closely monitor the pilot for speed of transactions, user errors, fraud attempts, and cost metrics. Gather feedback from users: Did grandmothers in the village feel comfortable using the code? Did agents encounter any liquidity issues? Also measure the fee savings: for example, if the traditional cost was 7% and we achieved 3%, document that 4% difference as increased disposable income for recipients. Success criteria for phase 2 would include high redemption rates (few vouchers left unclaimed or failed) and positive user feedback on convenience.
Phase 3: Refine and Expand to Multiple Communities. Using lessons from the initial pilot, iterate on the technology (perhaps improving offline verification methods or adding multi-language support for SMS) and the operational model (tweaking agent commissions or training). Expand to a larger user base, possibly across two or three remittance corridors or aid projects. This phase could involve a formal partnership with an international remittance provider or a humanitarian organization to embed the solution in their operations. For example, partner with a diaspora association to distribute vouchers during a holiday when remittances spike, or with a relief NGO for a seasonal cash assistance round. Increasing scale will test the robustness and scalability of the blockchain network chosen – whether it can handle thousands of micro-transactions quickly and cheaply. It will also test agent network management on a broader scale (ensuring agents have enough cash liquidity and trust the system as volumes grow).
Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration and Policy Engagement. After demonstrating viability, the next step is to integrate with existing financial ecosystems for long-term sustainability. This means working with mobile money providers, microfinance institutions, and even banks or post offices to fold the voucher redemption into their service offerings. For instance, a mobile money operator could adopt our protocol to power their international remittance feature, essentially using the blockchain back-end but a seamless front-end for their users. Engaging regulators is crucial here: by showing transparent transaction data and compliance reports from pilot phases, we can lobby for supportive regulation of crypto-based remittances and e-vouchers (emphasizing consumer protection and low cost). The aim is to get endorsements or at least acceptance from central banks or financial authorities in pilot countries, which will open the door to scale up nationwide. We would also explore subsidy or funding opportunities – for example, development agencies might subsidize agent training or initial setup in poorer areas to accelerate network reach.
Phase 5: Scale and Diversification. Finally, scale the network globally in a responsible manner. This could mean onboarding major remittance hubs (the U.S., EU, Gulf) as send markets and multiple receive markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A governance structure should be in place, potentially a consortium or a non-profit foundation, to oversee the protocol (especially if it’s open-source) and ensure interoperability standards as different players (telcos, NGOs, fintech startups) join in various countries. Over time, the protocol might diversify into other services: savings groups could use claim codes as passbooks, or micro-insurance payouts delivered via vouchers. New technology like satellite connectivity (e.g. using Blockstream’s satellite for Bitcoinhackernoon.com) could be leveraged to reach truly offline areas with blockchain access. The roadmap’s end vision is an open financial web where someone in a city can send digital cash to someone in a remote village as easily as sending an SMS, and that village recipient can turn it into food, medicine, or cash on the spot, with negligible overhead. This directly contributes to the SDGs on reducing inequality and enabling decent work by making the global financial system more inclusive.
Throughout these phases, continuous monitoring and research will be conducted. Partnerships with academic institutions or think tanks (for example, to study the socioeconomic impact of the pilot on households) can provide valuable data. We expect to track indicators such as cost saved per $100 sent, time saved per transaction, increase in financial account ownership in the community, and user empowerment metrics (like whether women are able to control their remittance income more directly).
By following this roadmap, we anticipate proving that a walletless, agent-based crypto protocol is not only technically sound but also socially transformative. It directly tackles the pain points identified: high fees are reduced, unbanked recipients are included via agents, and aid can reach those left out of the traditional banking system. Ultimately, this approach could form part of a new financial infrastructure for the developing world – one that bridges modern digital finance with the reality of cash-based local economies, in a way that is secure, affordable, and human-centered.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the convergence of humanitarian need, economic evidence, and emerging technology makes now the ideal time to deploy a walletless, agent-driven crypto remittance system. We have detailed the substantial benefits: remittance recipients will get more of each dollar sent, rural families and crisis-affected populations will gain access to digital financial value without expensive prerequisites, and aid organizations will deliver assistance faster and more accountably. The protocol leverages cutting-edge blockchain features (smart contracts, stablecoins) but delivers them through accessible interfaces (SMS codes, local agents) – essentially translating fintech innovation into a form usable by anyone, anywhere. By building on proven models (like mobile money agent networks and voucher-based aid) and enhancing them with decentralized technology, this solution can overcome long-standing barriers in financial inclusion.
The supporting research and pilot experiences give confidence that this model is both necessary and feasible. Remittances have a well-documented development impactblogs.worldbank.org, and lowering their cost and widening their reach can amplify poverty reduction. Humanitarian pilots from the South Pacific to the Middle East have shown digital vouchers can save costs and uphold dignity for beneficiariesoxfam.orginnovation.wfp.org. Technical projects in Africa have connected blockchain to basic phones, proving the “last mile” gap can be closedtreasuryxl.comcryptoaltruism.org. Our proposed system ties these threads together into a unified protocol aimed at real-world implementation.
Moving forward, collaboration will be key. We need to bring together the expertise of NGOs, fintech innovators, governments, and local communities to pilot and refine the approach. If successfully scaled, a walletless crypto remittance network could funnel billions more dollars directly into the hands of those who need it most, boosting local economies and household welfare. It represents a fusion of technology and human agency: high-tech infrastructure empowering grassroots agents and end-users. In a time when digital transformation often risks leaving the poorest behind, this project is an opportunity to ensure the benefits of blockchain and digital finance are inclusive by design. By focusing on the unconnected and the vulnerable, we can revolutionize remittances and aid for greater equity, resilience, and impact on a global scale.
