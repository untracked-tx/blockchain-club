## Blockchain Deployment Options

| Chain                | Pros                                               | Cons                                                | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Polygon Mainnet**  | Low gas fees, widely used, EVM-compatible          | Slightly slower than L2s, still ~$0.01 per mint     | Best balance for production |
| **Polygon Amoy**     | Free for testing, compatible with Polygon tools    | Not visible to wallets; testnet only                | Used for MVP demo |
| **Ethereum Mainnet** | Most secure, universal support                     | Extremely expensive (>$100 deploy, $10+ mint)       | Not suitable for students |
| **Base / Optimism / Arbitrum** | Low fees, fast, developer-friendly        | Smaller ecosystem, less NFT wallet visibility       | Good alternative for DAO scaling |
| **Zora / Celo**      | Built for creators & NFTs                          | Limited DAO tooling, niche chain                    | Optional for event-specific drops |

## NFT Standards & Token Design

| Standard                | Description                              | Pros                                    | Cons                                 | Use When |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| **ERC-721**             | Standard NFT                              | Simple, well-supported                  | No built-in token indexing           | MVP-level token |
| **ERC-721Enumerable**   | Adds indexing, owner token lists         | Supports advanced voting, dashboards    | More gas-intensive (especially mint) | Use with DAO or Snapshot roles |
| **Soulbound (non-transferable)** | Prevents token transfers       | Identity-bound, prevents resale         | Less flexible for gifting/sales      | Ideal for dues-only credentials |
| **ERC-1155**            | Multi-token format (not used here)        | Efficient batch minting                 | Overkill for single-role NFTs        | Only if adding other token types |

## Feature Considerations

| Feature                        | Purpose                            | Pros                          | Cons                           | Status       |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Minting via dues payment      | Enforce access + club funding      | Simple UX                     | Requires gas for mint          | Implemented |
| On-chain member metadata      | Store name, role, join date        | Supports role-based voting    | Adds gas + data complexity     | Future |
| Snapshot voting integration   | DAO-style governance               | Gasless, role-weighted votes  | Needs visible token ownership  | Future |
| Gnosis Safe treasury          | Shared, secure fund control        | Multisig, auditable spending  | Needs setup + wallet approvals | Future |
| Role-based permissions        | Limit admin updates to officers    | Strong access control         | Slight learning curve          | Future |
| Soulbound toggle              | Prevent NFT transfers              | Aligns with ID-based roles    | Can't move NFTs between wallets | Optional |

## Deployment & Growth Strategy

### Start:
- Testnet deployment (Done)
- MVP contract: ERC-721, low-cost, no soulbound, simple minting

### Mid-Term:
- Add metadata (name, role, join date)
- Deploy on Polygon Mainnet or Base
- Implement Snapshot for proposals + votes
- Launch Gnosis Safe for transparent dues treasury

### Advanced:
- Migrate to soulbound NFTs (if club prefers)
- Build NFT dashboard or explore multi-club DAOs
- Cross-semester NFT recognition or alumni token tiers

## Discussion Prompts for the Team

- Do we want members to be able to transfer their NFTs?
- What chain are we most comfortable using for "real" deployments?
- Should we use role-weighted voting, or equal votes per member?
- Who wants access to help shape treasury governance?
- Should we support alumni participation with different NFTs?
