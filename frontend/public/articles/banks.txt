Central Banks vs. Cryptocurrency: Global Adoption
Surges and Institutional Pushback
Crypto Adoption Amid Currency Crises: Country Case Studies
Nigeria: Devaluation and a Crypto Surge
Nigeria has emerged as a global leader in grassroots crypto adoption, driven largely by economic instability.
The naira’s value has plummeted amid high inflation and repeated devaluations – hitting a record low in
early 2024
. As the currency lost value, Nigerians increasingly turned to cryptocurrencies (especially U.S.
dollar-pegged stablecoins) to preserve savings and facilitate trade. Nigeria ranked  second worldwide in
2023 for crypto adoption, transacting about $59 billion in crypto between July 2023 and June 2024
. A
major use case has been small-scale transfers and remittances: roughly 85% of Nigeria’s crypto transfers
are under $1 million, often for everyday needs like bill payments and cross-border commerce
.
Stablecoin inflows correlate with naira depreciation – whenever the naira takes a sharp dive, Nigerians pile
into stablecoins as a dollar substitute
. For example, after a steep devaluation in 2024, quarterly
stablecoin transaction volume in Nigeria approached $3 billion
. This trend shows how crypto has
become a monetary lifeline amid currency crisis.
Regulators, however, have pushed back. In February 2021 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) prohibited
banks from servicing crypto exchanges or accounts, effectively forcing the crypto sector onto peer-to-peer
channels
. While crypto was not outlawed for individuals, the ban aimed to protect the naira and
stem capital flight. Nigeria later introduced its own central bank digital currency (the eNaira), but uptake
was  minimal  as  the  public  remained  more  interested  in  Bitcoin  or  stablecoins
.  By  2023–24,
authorities  escalated  the  crackdown:  Nigeria’s  economic  crimes  agency  detained  crypto  exchange
executives and accused platforms like Binance of facilitating illicit outflows that undermine the naira
. The central bank governor warned that over $26 billion flowed through Binance Nigeria in a year
from unidentifiable sources
 – highlighting officials’ fears that Nigerians are using crypto to bypass
currency controls. Despite these measures, Nigeria’s young, tech-savvy population continues to flock to
crypto as trust in traditional systems falters. Surveys indicate everyday activities – from grocery purchases
to mobile airtime top-ups – are increasingly paid in crypto
, reflecting a grassroots economic adaptation
that even strict regulations have struggled to contain.
Argentina: Inflation and the Flight to Stablecoins
Few countries illustrate crypto adoption under financial duress as vividly as Argentina. The country has
faced soaring inflation (over 250% year-on-year by early 2024) and repeated peso devaluations, eroding
public confidence in the national currency
. In response, Argentines have embraced cryptocurrencies –
particularly USD-linked stablecoins – as an alternative store of value and payment medium. Roughly  5
million Argentinians (over 10% of the population) were using crypto for everyday transactions or as a
hedge against inflation by 2024
. This makes Argentina the leading crypto user in Latin America by
volume, with about  $85 billion in crypto value transacted in a year, and it ranks  second globally in

Chainalysis’s adoption index
. Crucially, Argentines favor stablecoins like Tether (USDT) – recent data
show stablecoins made up about 62% of Argentina’s crypto transaction volume in 2023, far above the
global  average
.  Whenever  the  peso  takes  a  hit  or  capital  controls  tighten,  local  demand  for
stablecoins surges as people scramble to protect their money in dollar-pegged tokens
. Indeed, in late
2023 when Argentina’s government devalued the peso by 50% overnight, stablecoin purchase volumes
spiked dramatically
.
Argentine businesses and savers have also integrated crypto into daily life. Many use stablecoins to settle
trades or make international payments that would otherwise be impeded by strict currency controls
.
Crypto ATMs and payment apps have appeared, and even some political leaders champion crypto – for
instance, the recently elected President Javier Milei has floated plans to allow Argentinians to “use whatever
currency they want,” including Bitcoin
. Despite this grassroots enthusiasm, Argentina’s central bank and
the IMF have viewed the trend warily. In early 2022, as Argentina negotiated a $45 billion debt relief
package, the  IMF insisted on a provision to “discourage the use of cryptocurrencies” to safeguard
financial stability
. Soon after, Argentina’s Central Bank issued a blanket prohibition on banks offering
crypto services (effectively curtailing formal crypto trading) – a move made “weeks after” the IMF deal and
widely  seen  as  complying  with  IMF  conditions
.  Thus,  Argentina  encapsulates  the  tug-of-war
between a populace embracing crypto to survive economic collapse and institutions worried about losing
control of the monetary system.
Turkey: Lira Collapse and Bitcoin as a “Savior”
Turkey has experienced extreme currency volatility and inflation, which in turn ignited one of the world’s
most active crypto markets. Over the past few years, annual inflation in Turkey officially hit 79% – with
independent estimates suggesting real inflation reached triple digits (possibly over 100–150% during 2022)
. The Turkish lira lost roughly 40% of its value in 2021 and another 26% in 2022 against the dollar
,
decimating real wages and savings. In this environment, millions of Turks flocked to Bitcoin, Tether, and
other cryptocurrencies as an inflation hedge and a way to access hard currency. By some estimates,
between 8 and 14 million Turks (about 10–17% of the population) have used or invested in cryptocurrency
in recent years
. Daily crypto trading activity in Turkey exceeded 1 million transactions by early 2021,
and in late 2021, lira-based crypto trading volume averaged  $1.8 billion per day
 – reflecting frantic
demand for stable assets as the lira’s value eroded.
The Turkish government’s stance has been ambivalent. In April 2021, Turkey’s central bank banned the
use of crypto for payments, citing risks to the financial system and the need to protect the lira
. This
came immediately after two domestic crypto exchanges (Thodex and Vebitcoin) collapsed amid scandals,
which shook public trust in unregulated platforms
. However, trading and holding crypto remained legal,
and interest only grew. By 2023, surveys suggested over half of Turkish adults had dabbled in crypto –
up from 40% in late 2021 to 52% by mid-2023 – predominantly to preserve the value of their assets in an
inflationary economy
. Many Turks describe crypto as “basically a savior” for their finances
. They use
it to  save in dollars via stablecoins, make quick transfers, or invest in Bitcoin as digital gold. Even as
authorities develop a central bank digital currency (the digital lira) and consider stricter regulations, Turkey’s
youthful, tech-forward population views crypto as a refuge from economic mismanagement. The country’s
example shows how public adoption can surge despite – or even because of – regulatory crackdowns,
when people lose faith in fiat currency stability.

Russia: Sanctions, Ruble Troubles, and a Policy Pivot
Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrency has evolved dramatically under the pressure of sanctions and
financial isolation. Before 2022, Russians were already active crypto users (Russia ranked in the  top 10
globally for adoption in 2021–22)
. The Kremlin’s official line, however, was hostile: the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR) warned that crypto could undermine the ruble and in early 2022 pushed for a complete ban
on cryptocurrency trading and mining
. That stance abruptly softened after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
in February 2022 led to harsh Western sanctions. Cut off from parts of the global banking system, Russia
began exploring crypto as a sanctions workaround. By late 2022, the government legalized cross-border
cryptocurrency  payments  for  trade,  and  in  August  2024  President  Putin  signed  laws  permitting
international trade via crypto and legalizing crypto mining for licensed businesses
. This marked a
U-turn from the CBR’s earlier hardline approach. Top officials openly acknowledged the move was aimed at
mitigating sanctions’ impact and reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar in trade
.
On the domestic front, Russia still bans using crypto for everyday purchases, keeping the ruble as the
only legal tender
. Nonetheless, Russian individuals continue to transact heavily in crypto through
exchanges and peer networks. Chainalysis reports Russia “consistently ranks among the top” countries in its
adoption index, suggesting that blanket bans have been largely ineffective in curbing use
. Following
the war’s outbreak, crypto transfers spiked in both Russia and Ukraine as citizens sought to move money
and safeguard assets
. There is evidence of Russians converting savings to Bitcoin or stablecoins when
the ruble sank, or using crypto to evade capital controls. In response, Western authorities tightened
sanctions to  block Russian access to crypto services (for example, the EU barred high-value crypto
services to Russians in 2022). Despite those restrictions, Russian trading volumes remain significant. Even
major state-linked banks like Rosbank quietly piloted cross-border crypto settlement solutions in 2022
.
In sum, Russia illustrates how a country under financial siege might  pivot from banning crypto to
cautiously embracing it as a tool for economic survival – all while trying to keep domestic monetary
sovereignty intact via restrictions on local crypto use.
Lebanon: Financial Collapse and Bitcoin Lifeline
Lebanon’s financial system meltdown since 2019 has driven a segment of its population to adopt crypto out
of sheer necessity. The World Bank has called Lebanon’s economic crisis “one of the worst globally since the
1850s”
. The Lebanese pound has lost over 98% of its value since 2019
, and inflation hit an annual
rate of 171% in 2022 (after an even higher 290% in 2021)
. Compounding the crisis, banks imposed
draconian capital controls and  froze depositors’ accounts, essentially trapping people’s life savings. By
2023, an estimated 78% of Lebanese were living below the poverty line
. In this chaos, many Lebanese –
particularly younger, tech-savvy citizens – have turned to cryptocurrency for relief.  Bitcoin and Tether
(USDT) became  alternative  means  to  store  value  and  transact  when  banks  wouldn’t  allow  dollar
withdrawals. As one Beirut resident put it, “this digital currency is 100 times more real than the ‘lollars’ we
have in the bank,” referring to U.S. dollar balances stuck in Lebanon’s banking system
.
Cryptocurrency trading in Lebanon often operates through informal, peer-to-peer channels. Dozens of
encrypted WhatsApp and Telegram groups connect buyers and sellers who swap fiat cash for crypto in
person, a workaround to the frozen banking network
. The majority of these trades are in stablecoins
like USDT, effectively providing people with digital dollars to pay for groceries and essentials
. Even
some miners have popped up in Lebanon: entrepreneurs take advantage of subsidized electricity to mine
Bitcoin, earning hard currency amid a local cash shortage
. The scale of this trend is notable – by

2021 Lebanon briefly ranked among the top countries for per-capita crypto usage in Chainalysis reports,
and  local  crypto  dealers  report  serving  clients  from  college  students  to  politicians  and  media
personalities
. The government and central bank, for their part, have provided no clear regulatory
framework  (crypto  exists  in  a  legal  grey  zone  in  Lebanon
).  Banks  even  went  on  strike  in  2023,
periodically halting all withdrawals
, which only reinforced the population’s  mistrust of traditional
finance. While crypto is far from mainstream in Lebanon, it has undoubtedly been a monetary lifeline for a
growing sub-section of Lebanese seeking to survive an ongoing financial nightmare.
Afghanistan: Between Adoption and Repression under the Taliban
Afghanistan experienced a brief boom in cryptocurrency usage in 2021, followed by a harsh crackdown
once the Taliban consolidated power. After the fall of Kabul in August 2021, Afghanistan’s economy was
plunged into isolation – foreign aid was frozen, banks struggled, and millions of Afghans were cut off from
the  global  financial  system  due  to  sanctions  against  the  Taliban  regime.  In  this  void,  some  Afghans
(including women and younger people adept with tech) turned to crypto to preserve whatever wealth
they  had  and  to  enable  cross-border  transactions outside  of  traditional  banks
.  By  late  2021,
Afghanistan surprisingly ranked in the top 20 of Chainalysis’s Global Crypto Adoption Index, reflecting
significant peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading activity. Stablecoins also gained a foothold as a means of moving
money in and out of the country for those with family abroad
.
The Taliban’s response was swift and negative. In early 2022, Taliban officials warned that crypto trading
was illegal under Islamic finance unless formally approved. Then in August 2022, the Afghan central bank
(now under Taliban control) banned all cryptocurrency nationwide, declaring that digital currencies like
Bitcoin are “fraudulent” and not recognized
. Afghan police raided crypto dealers in the city of Herat – a
local  hub  for  crypto  activity  –  arresting  13  people and  shutting  down  at  least  20  cryptocurrency
businesses that had sprung up
. “Money changers, individuals, and businesspeople” were ordered to
cease  dealing  in  digital  assets,  according  to  the  head  of  Herat’s  cyber  crimes  unit
.  The  Taliban
crackdown illustrates the regime’s fear of losing control over capital flows. Crypto had provided ordinary
Afghans an escape hatch from the Taliban’s tight restrictions and the sanctions-strangled banking system,
but that window is now closed. The Afghan example underscores that while crypto can thrive in crisis
conditions, an authoritarian power can still snuff it out – driving any remaining usage deeply underground.
Ukraine: War, Donations, and Rapid Crypto Adoption
The Russia-Ukraine war has accelerated cryptocurrency adoption in Ukraine, as the embattled nation
embraced digital assets for both emergency funding and as an economic stabilizer. Even prior to the war,
Ukraine was a tech-forward country with high crypto usage – in 2020 and 2021, it ranked among the top
three countries globally in crypto adoption according to Chainalysis (Ukraine was 3rd and Russia 9th in
2022)
. After the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, crypto quickly became part of Ukraine’s
financial defense. The Ukrainian government openly solicited crypto donations to fund its military and
humanitarian response. In the first month of the war, the government’s official crypto wallets received over
$56 million in donations
 (mostly in Bitcoin and Ethereum), which were rapidly deployed to buy medical
supplies, drones, and other wartime essentials. “The people of Ukraine are grateful for the support from the
global crypto community,” the government tweeted in May 2022, highlighting how the  decentralized
nature of crypto enabled fast, borderless aid in a conflict zone
.

Ukraine’s parliament had actually passed a law to legalize and regulate virtual assets just weeks after war
broke out, and by March 2022 President Zelensky signed it, establishing a framework for exchanges and
oversight
. This legal clarity helped integrate crypto into the economy. Since many Ukrainians were
displaced or lost access to banking,  cryptocurrency provided a fallback for daily finances – some
refugees carried Bitcoin wallets instead of cash, and others used stablecoins to receive remittances when
banking lines were disrupted. Overall crypto transaction volumes in Ukraine spiked after the invasion began
.  Chainalysis  noted  that  both  Ukraine  and  Russia  saw  “increases  in  crypto  transfers  immediately
following the invasion” as people coped with currency volatility and economic dislocation
. By 2023,
Ukraine remained a global leader in adoption, reflecting how ingrained crypto had become amid the crisis
. On the flip side, there was concern about illicit crypto flows aiding Russia, but analytics firms found
pro-Ukrainian crypto fundraising far outstripped that of pro-Russian groups (by about 44-to-1 in value)
. Ukraine’s case demonstrates an unprecedented use of crypto on a national scale: from crowdfunding
defense efforts to keeping the economy running under siege, all while the central bank and government
actively collaborate with the crypto sector rather than fight it.
Central Banks, the IMF, and Crypto Backlash
Around the world, the rise of crypto as an alternative financial rail has prompted significant pushback from
central banks and international institutions. Many monetary authorities view unregulated crypto as a
threat to capital controls, monetary sovereignty, and financial stability – especially in countries facing
economic stress. In numerous cases, central banks have attempted to suppress or regulate crypto usage
in response to its growing popularity:
Bans on Banking Support: A common tactic has been to bar banks and payment companies from
interacting with crypto. For example, Nigeria’s central bank in 2021 ordered all commercial banks to
freeze any accounts involved in cryptocurrency trading
. This effectively cut off exchanges from
the banking system and forced Nigerian crypto users into peer-to-peer channels
. Similarly,
India’s  central  bank  (RBI) issued  a  circular  in  2018  preventing  banks  from  servicing  crypto
businesses (a ban later overturned by courts in 2020), and Pakistan’s central bank in 2023 moved to
ban crypto entirely as the country sought an IMF bailout. These measures are aimed at choking the
fiat on-ramps that allow people to convert local currency into crypto and vice versa.
Outright Usage Bans: Some authorities have prohibited certain crypto activities. In Turkey, where
inflation was eroding the lira, the central bank  banned the use of crypto for payments in April
2021,  citing  the  need  to  protect  the  Turkish  lira  and  consumers  from  volatility
.  In  China,
concerned with capital flight and financial scams, the central bank (PBoC) went even further – by late
2021 China imposed a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency trading and mining. These heavy-handed
bans, however, often drive activity underground rather than eliminate it. As Chainalysis observed,
countries  like  Russia  and  Nigeria  that  have  attempted  bans  remain  among  the  top  in  crypto
adoption, suggesting informal markets simply take over
.
Regulatory Crackdowns and Licenses: Several countries have chosen to regulate rather than ban,
but with strict conditions. Governments from South Korea to the European Union have rolled out
licensing, KYC/AML requirements, and reporting rules to bring crypto into the regulatory perimeter.
In Nigeria, after the initial clampdown, the Securities and Exchange Commission later issued rules to
register and license digital asset platforms (though implementation has been slow)
. These
efforts  reflect  concerns  about  money  laundering,  fraud,  and  the  destabilizing  effect of

unmonitored  capital  flows.  Even  where  crypto  is  not  banned,  central  banks  frequently  issue
warnings  to  the  public  about  the  risks  of  crypto-assets  and  have  tightened  foreign  exchange
regulations to prevent crypto-based capital evasion.
Promotion of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Many central banks are also developing
their own digital currencies, partly as a state-sanctioned alternative to crypto. Nigeria’s eNaira,
the Eastern Caribbean CBDC (DCash), and projects in India and China all aim to provide digital
payment  options  under  central  bank  control.  The  IMF  notes  that  interest  in  CBDCs  is  high  in
emerging markets facing crypto adoption, as authorities hope a CBDC can offer the convenience of
crypto without ceding monetary control
. However, early results (e.g. eNaira’s low uptake in
Nigeria
) suggest that a CBDC does not easily displace decentralized crypto unless it truly solves
users’ needs.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global financial bodies have also reacted strongly to
the crypto trend, especially when it intersects with sovereign debt or monetary policy. The IMF in particular
has used its influence (and loan conditionality) to dissuade countries from embracing cryptocurrency:
In  March  2022,  the  IMF  required  Argentina to  explicitly  commit  to  “discourage  the  use  of
cryptocurrencies”  as  part  of  a  $45  billion  debt  restructuring  agreement
.  Within  weeks,
Argentina’s central bank issued its ban on banks dealing in crypto, aligning with the IMF’s stance
.
This episode showed the IMF’s concern that widespread crypto use could exacerbate Argentina’s
inflation and undermine its banking system, complicating the country’s path to stability.
The IMF has consistently warned smaller economies against adopting crypto as legal tender. In
January 2022, IMF Executive Directors formally urged El Salvador to revoke Bitcoin’s legal
currency  status,  citing  “large  risks”  to  financial  stability,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  consumer
protection
. They highlighted potential contingent liabilities of the government if crypto holdings
lost value
. The IMF similarly criticized the Central African Republic’s surprise 2022 decision to
adopt Bitcoin, and it has generally discouraged any move that  elevates crypto to the level of
national currency.
In  February 2023, the IMF released a policy paper on crypto that distilled its advice:  “crypto
assets should not be granted official currency or legal tender status” in order to safeguard
monetary sovereignty
. IMF officials argue that if a country uses crypto as an official currency, it
loses control over money supply and could face instability
. This view has been endorsed by the
broader  international  community  (for  instance,  the  G20  and  Financial  Stability  Board  echoed
concerns about legal tender status in 2023).
Pressure through Financial Channels: Countries that flirt with crypto at a national level have felt
indirect  pressures  too.  Rating  agencies  and  foreign  investors  often  react  negatively,  raising
borrowing costs. When El Salvador adopted Bitcoin,  Moody’s and Fitch downgraded its credit
rating, partly citing uncertainty around the Bitcoin experiment and impeded IMF relations
.
Similarly, when Zimbabwe announced a gold-backed digital currency in 2023 as a radical move to
stabilize its dollar, the IMF swiftly cautioned against it, suggesting the government instead focus on
conventional stabilization and warning that the gold token could backfire
. In essence, global
institutions have signaled that departing from orthodox monetary frameworks – whether through
crypto or other unconventional means – may invite financial isolation or reduced support.

In summary, central banks and the IMF have been largely defensive in the face of crypto’s rise. Their
responses range from outright bans and legal restrictions to more subtle forms of pressure and co-option
(like developing CBDCs). The recurring theme is a fear of  losing monetary control: widespread crypto
adoption  can  enable  capital  flight  (draining  FX  reserves),  complicate  bank  regulation,  and  potentially
facilitate illicit finance, all of which threaten orthodox policy tools. Yet, as the earlier case studies show,
people often turn to crypto precisely when institutions fail them – when currencies collapse, banks freeze
withdrawals, or international sanctions bite. This has created a fundamental tension: the more populations
gravitate toward crypto out of necessity or mistrust, the more forcefully central authorities seem to clamp
down, even at the cost of driving innovation and finance into the shadows.
El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law: A National Experiment and its Fallout
One of the most pivotal events in the crypto-government saga was El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as
legal tender – a world-first initiative that sparked celebration in the crypto community and alarm among
traditional financial stewards. In June 2021, President Nayib Bukele pushed a bill through El Salvador’s
legislature (which his party controlled) to make Bitcoin an official currency alongside the U.S. dollar. The
“Bitcoin Law” took effect on September 7, 2021, requiring all merchants to accept Bitcoin for payments
(technically, where they had the technology) and allowing taxes and debts to be paid in BTC
. The
government launched a national Bitcoin wallet app (“Chivo”) and even gave citizens $30 in BTC as an
incentive  to  jump-start  usage.  Bukele  touted  Bitcoin  adoption  as  a  way  to  attract  investment,  lower
remittance fees, and “bank the unbanked” in El Salvador’s cash-heavy economy. By making his country the
test case for nation-state Bitcoin adoption, Bukele instantly became an icon to crypto enthusiasts
 –
but he also invited swift backlash from financial institutions and skeptics.
Domestic reception of the Bitcoin Law was mixed. While younger entrepreneurs and Bitcoin believers
embraced it, polls early on showed most Salvadorans were wary of Bitcoin’s volatility. Small street vendors
often preferred dollars despite the law, and there were protests in San Salvador by citizens who feared the
policy was a reckless gamble with national finances. Many did download the Chivo wallet for the $30 bonus,
but studies later found that  the vast majority spent the bonus and did not continue using Bitcoin
regularly (indicating low sustained adoption on the ground). Within a few months,  less than 2% of
remittances were coming via crypto channels, and surveys suggested most businesses rarely saw Bitcoin
transactions – dollars remained dominant. However, Bukele’s government reported some successes: they
claimed increased tourism in 2022 was partly due to Bitcoin curiosity, and a few Bitcoin companies began
investing in the country. Bukele himself periodically announced government Bitcoin purchases (eventually
accumulating 2,381 BTC by end of 2022) and even planned a “Bitcoin City” powered by a volcano. These
moves kept El Salvador in the international spotlight, for better or worse.
International pushback was immediate. The IMF strongly objected from the outset: even before the law
took effect, the IMF warned of “macroeconomic, financial and legal issues” with adopting Bitcoin
. El
Salvador was seeking a $1 billion+ loan from the IMF at the time, and those talks were quickly clouded by
the Bitcoin decision. In January 2022, the IMF’s Executive Board issued a rare public exhortation for El
Salvador to “narrow the scope of the Bitcoin Law by removing Bitcoin’s legal tender status.” Directors
highlighted risks to financial stability, consumer protection, and fiscal liabilities, and made clear that Bitcoin
was a major obstacle to an IMF deal
. In fact, the IMF board’s statement explicitly linked El Salvador’s
ability to get a loan with its handling of the Bitcoin experiment
. Other institutions echoed concerns:
the World Bank refused to provide technical assistance to El Salvador’s implementation of Bitcoin, citing
transparency and environmental concerns (a reference to Bitcoin mining’s energy use)
. The U.S.

government also showed unease – some U.S. senators proposed the ‘‘ACES Act’’ to review El Salvador’s
Bitcoin adoption and its implications for U.S. anti-money-laundering policy.
Financial markets reacted by demanding higher risk premiums on El Salvador’s bonds. Within days of the
Bitcoin Law’s passage, credit rating agencies warned it could imperil El Salvador’s access to external
financing. Moody’s downgraded El Salvador in July 2021, mentioning Bitcoin as a factor undermining the
government’s creditworthiness. Eurobond yields spiked to distress levels in 2022 as investors worried El
Salvador might default (it had a large bond coming due in early 2023 and no IMF backstop). Bukele’s
administration in turn accused the IMF and media of fear-mongering, and in late 2022 it managed to
repurchase some debt and avert default, helped by a loan from other sources (there were reports of talks
with China). Still, the economic implications of the Bitcoin policy were significant: El Salvador spent public
funds on Bitcoin (which lost value during the 2022 bear market), struggled to raise external financing, and
saw  no clear immediate fiscal benefits from Bitcoin adoption.  Consumer uptake remained low, and the
hoped-for surge in crypto investment largely didn’t materialize beyond a few Bitcoin vending machines and
blockchain startups setting up shop.
By late 2023, El Salvador shifted to a more pragmatic approach. The government toned down aggressive
promotion of Bitcoin and focused on fiscal repair. In November 2023, El Salvador successfully issued
traditional bonds again, and in early 2024 it finally clinched an agreement with the IMF for a $1.4 billion
loan package
. Notably, as part of that deal, El Salvador agreed to certain concessions on its Bitcoin
policy: it pledged that  taxes would be paid only in U.S. dollars (not Bitcoin) and that  acceptance of
Bitcoin by merchants would be purely voluntary
. These steps, essentially codifying what was
already happening informally, reassured the IMF that dollar primacy would be maintained. Bukele’s team
insisted they did  not roll back the Bitcoin Law, and even created a “Bitcoin Office” to continue attracting
crypto business. Indeed, officials declared El Salvador would keep Bitcoin as legal tender and continue
accumulating BTC in its treasury
 – despite IMF caution. But the practical adjustments (making it clear
merchants  can  decline  Bitcoin,  and  the  government  will  not  collect  taxes  or  pay  salaries  in  Bitcoin)
narrowed the law’s scope, addressing the IMF’s core demands. An IMF spokesperson noted these reforms
“make acceptance of bitcoin by the private sector voluntary,” resolving a key sticking point
.
Political implications of the Bitcoin Law have been fascinating as well. Domestically, Bukele used the
Bitcoin initiative to brand himself as an innovative, anti-establishment leader willing to break norms. This
played well with his base and with the international crypto community, but it also became a rallying point
for Salvadoran opposition (who argued he was gambling with the economy). However, Bukele’s overall
popularity remained very high throughout 2021–2023, largely due to unrelated policies (like his crackdown
on gangs). Internationally, the Bitcoin Law strained El Salvador’s relations with traditional partners like the
IMF, but strengthened ties with some crypto-sector players and possibly non-Western allies. El Salvador
positioned itself as a pioneer of financial freedom, hosting international Bitcoin conferences and even
inspiring other nations (the Central African Republic briefly followed with its own Bitcoin legal tender
announcement in 2022, though under very different circumstances). In the long run, Bukele has tied his
legacy  to  the  Bitcoin  experiment’s  outcome.  If  Bitcoin’s  price  were  to  soar  or  if  the  crypto  industry
significantly boosts El Salvador’s economy, he will claim vindication. If it flounders, future governments
could quietly reverse course.
In summary, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law exemplified the “wildcard” scenario of a nation exiting traditional
finance norms (CeFi) and the robust institutional pushback such a move can trigger. The country had to
navigate financial retaliation (or at least loss of support) – loans delayed, credit downgraded – and it
76

adjusted course to avoid economic calamity, all while symbolically holding onto its Bitcoin dream. The
episode yielded important lessons: it tested crypto at a country scale, exposed the incompatibility of Bitcoin
volatility with national budgets, and provoked discussion at the highest levels of global finance. As of 2025,
El Salvador continues its Bitcoin experiment, but tempered by hard economic realities and an uneasy truce
with the guardians of the orthodox financial order
.
“Wildcards” of Monetary Independence: Ecuador, Venezuela,
Zimbabwe and Others
Beyond the headline cases, a number of countries have pursued unconventional monetary paths – whether
embracing crypto or attempting to break from established currency systems – and often met stiff resistance
or unintended consequences. These  “wildcard” cases highlight what can happen when nations seek
monetary independence in defiance of economic orthodoxy:
Ecuador’s Reversal of Dollarization Attempt: Ecuador has been fully  dollarized (using the US
dollar as its currency) since a 2000 banking crisis. In 2014, under President Rafael Correa, Ecuador
launched the world’s first central bank digital currency –  Dinero Electrónico, a state-run mobile
money – and  simultaneously banned decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
. The
official rationale was to modernize payments and include the unbanked, but analysts speculated this
could be a  step toward de-dollarization, allowing the government to issue a digital Sucre and
regain monetary control
. Such a move risked capital flight and public backlash, as Ecuadorians
distrusted anything that might replace the stable U.S. dollar. Indeed, Correa had to publicly deny that
the new digital currency would replace dollars
. Uptake of Dinero Electrónico remained low –
Ecuadorians largely avoided it, and Bitcoin trading went underground due to the ban. By 2018, the
project was abandoned and Ecuador’s next government terminated the state e-currency, handing
mobile  payment  services  to  private  banks.  The  episode  shows  how  attempting  to  undo
dollarization (even indirectly via a digital scheme) can trigger alarm. The  IMF and economists
warned that introducing a parallel currency, digital or not, could undermine confidence and spur
devaluation  of  dollar  assets
.  In  the  end,  Ecuador  retreated,  illustrating  that  entrenched
dollarization is politically and economically difficult to unwind without precipitating a crisis.
Venezuela’s Crypto Experiments Under Sanctions: Venezuela offers a stark example of a country
trying to use crypto to escape a collapsing monetary system and punishing international sanctions.
Years  of  hyperinflation  (peaking  at  an  unfathomable  10,000,000%  in  2018
)  destroyed  the
Venezuelan bolivar, prompting many Venezuelans to pivot to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to
protect their wages and savings
. By the late 2010s, Venezuela consistently ranked high in
global crypto usage metrics; even those without bank accounts could store value in crypto and trade
peer-to-peer. By 2023, an estimated  9% of Venezuela’s remittances (over $5 billion total) were
being sent in cryptocurrency, equal to about $460 million in value
. Crypto became a vital channel
for diaspora Venezuelans sending money home, avoiding the government’s strict currency controls
and the gouging fees of black-market forex brokers. At the street level, some businesses in Caracas
began accepting payment in Bitcoin or Litecoin to obtain a more stable asset (or immediately
convert crypto to USD)
. All of this happened against the backdrop of U.S.-led sanctions on
Venezuela’s government and state oil company PDVSA.

Crucially, the Maduro government itself attempted to harness crypto as a sanctions workaround. In
2018 it launched the Petro, a national cryptocurrency “backed” by oil reserves, which was supposed to serve
as a sanctions-evading trade instrument and a new currency unit. The Petro, however, met swift retaliation:
the U.S. government  banned U.S. persons from dealing in the Petro and later expanded sanctions,
effectively kneecapping the Petro’s international viability
. With no major exchanges listing it and
Venezuelans themselves preferring dollars or Bitcoin, the Petro never gained real traction. It “could only be
used internally” and even there, uptake was minimal beyond some government-mandated uses
. By
2020, the Petro was trading at a fraction of its supposed value and had largely faded from relevance.
Meanwhile, Venezuelan authorities oscillated on broader crypto policy: they legalized and even encouraged
Bitcoin mining for a time (taking advantage of Venezuela’s subsidized electricity) and set up a regulatory
body for crypto (SUNACRIP) to register exchanges and miners. However, in 2023, amid an anti-corruption
purge, the government suddenly  cracked down on crypto miners and brokers, arresting the head of
SUNACRIP and seizing mining operations – a sign that the regime feared crypto’s role in facilitating graft or
capital flight out of its reach
. Venezuela’s turmoil demonstrates both the  utility and limits of
crypto in a sanctioned economy: citizens can use it as a lifeline (for remittances, savings, small trade) but
the state’s grander schemes like the Petro floundered under international pressure. Moreover, even where
crypto  use  is  high,  the  government  can  pivot  to  repression  if  it  perceives  crypto  is  undermining  its
remaining levers of control.
Zimbabwe’s Currency Reboots and Digital Gold Experiment: Zimbabwe is infamous for monetary
instability – from hyperinflation in 2008 that led to the abandonment of the Zimbabwean dollar, to
subsequent revival of a local currency that has been rapidly losing value again. Over the last two
decades, Zimbabwe has tried everything from dollarization (using USD and South African rand) to
introducing bond notes, and most recently, gold-backed digital tokens – effectively a quasi-
cryptocurrency issued by the central bank. With trust in the Zimbabwean dollar extremely low (by
2023 the Zim dollar traded around ZWL 2,000 per US$1 on the street
), Zimbabwe’s central
bank decided to issue digital gold tokens in May 2023 that people could buy and use as legal
tender, each token representing a claim on physical gold
. The plan was to mop up excess
ZWL liquidity by selling these gold-backed digital coins, hoping to provide a stable store of value and
curb inflation. The IMF swiftly cautioned Zimbabwe against this path, arguing that the authorities
should focus on tightening monetary policy and that the gold tokens could carry risks if not
implemented transparently
. Economists noted that without sufficient gold reserves (Zimbabwe
had only about $22 million worth of gold for backing initially
), the scheme might not scale, and it
essentially created a dual currency that could sow confusion.
Zimbabwe’s population, meanwhile, has shown interest in cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, etc.) as a hedge, but
the government has generally been hostile to private crypto. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
banned financial institutions from processing crypto transactions, calling them a danger to the financial
system. That ban was later eased into a de facto discouragement, but crypto remains unregulated and
somewhat underground in Zimbabwe. Many Zimbabweans simply use  U.S. dollars in cash or in foreign
bank accounts to protect their wealth, given that domestic alternatives are shaky. There have been reports
of growing crypto trading on platforms accessible via VPNs, and even some Zimbabweans mining crypto,
but data is scarce. Instead of embracing crypto, Zimbabwe’s government chose the route of a  state-
controlled digital currency (the gold token) to tackle its currency woes – essentially trying to harness the
appeal of crypto (a hard asset-backed currency) within a centrally managed framework. As of late
2024, the outcome is unclear: initial uptake of the gold tokens was modest, and the Zimbabwean dollar
continues to weaken, suggesting limited confidence in the scheme
. If it fails, Zimbabwe may end up
re-dollarizing  de facto yet again. The lesson from Zimbabwe is that  monetary improvisations, whether

through pseudo-cryptos or frequent currency resets, often struggle unless underlying fiscal and policy
issues are addressed – and that populations gravitate to whatever they perceive as stable (gold, USD, or
Bitcoin) regardless of official edicts.
Other Notable Cases: A few other nations merit mention. Iran, heavily sanctioned by the West,
turned to Bitcoin mining on an industrial scale (legalizing mining in 2019) as a way to monetize its
energy reserves and accumulate crypto that could pay for imports. However, Iran then oscillated,
cracking down on mining during electricity shortages and exploring a central bank digital currency
of its own. North Korea infamously has used crypto (through hacking and illicit means) to evade
sanctions, although that is a state-level abuse rather than adoption by the populace. Libya and Iraq
have seen some grassroots crypto activity in conflict conditions, but also stern warnings from
authorities not to deal in crypto. And Central African Republic (CAR) stunned observers by
declaring Bitcoin legal tender in 2022 (after El Salvador’s move) – a decision taken with almost no
infrastructure in place. The regional central bank of Central Africa (BEAC) and the IMF both criticized
CAR’s move, and within a year the CAR government appeared to backpedal, focusing on a token
project called Sango that went nowhere. This underlined that small economies face intense
external pressure if they veer outside established monetary norms (in CAR’s case, even the regional
monetary union’s rules were at stake)
. 
Collectively, these wildcard cases show that when countries attempt to chart an independent monetary
course – be it through crypto, quasi-crypto, or abandoning a peg – they often face a combination of
internal challenges and external pushback. Capital flees to safer havens, populations trust foreign
currency or crypto over new schemes, and institutions like the IMF, World Bank, or regional powers may
respond with financial pressure or public admonishment. Yet, these cases also demonstrate  why leaders
consider  such  paths:  conventional  options  may  be  exhausted,  and  the  allure  of  something  like
cryptocurrency or state digital money is that it offers a glimpse of escape from structural problems. In
practice, most of these experiments have had limited success to date. However, they provide invaluable
real-world data on the interplay between decentralized finance and the central banking world. As global
economic uncertainties continue, it’s likely we will see more such experiments – and with them, more
debates  about  the  balance  between  monetary  sovereignty,  innovation,  and  the  discipline  of  the
international financial system.
