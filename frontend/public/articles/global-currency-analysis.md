# One World, One Currency: Promise and Peril

## Introduction

The concept of a single global currency has been a subject of significant scholarly debate among economists and policymakers. Proponents argue that such a system could eliminate exchange rate volatility and currency crises, thereby providing a more stable foundation for international trade (Fontinelle, 2023).

This proposition holds particular appeal for nations that have experienced devastating hyperinflation, exemplified by Zimbabwe's 100 billion-dollar notes in 2008 and Venezuela's recent currency collapse. However, a critical question emerges: Would a universal currency genuinely facilitate stable prices across these economies, or would it predominantly advantage wealthy nations while exacerbating global inequality?

This fundamental inquiry positions inflation control against economic sovereignty and global equity. It also introduces pragmatic considerations regarding implementation: How might a world currency be operationalized given the heterogeneity of economies, political systems, and technological infrastructures? This analysis examines these dimensions through the lens of empirical evidence from the Eurozone and considers the potential alternative pathway offered by cryptocurrency. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of whether "One World, One Currency" represents an effective solution to economic instability or a catalyst for new disparities.

## Inflation Control: Cure for Hyperinflation or Loss of a Policy Instrument?

For nations experiencing chronic inflation or hyperinflation, adopting a stable universal currency represents a potential remedy. Theoretically, a global currency administered by a credible authority would prevent the excessive monetary expansion that undermines local currencies. Zimbabwe's inflation reached an unprecedented 89.7 sextillion percent in 2008, rendering even a $100 trillion note essentially valueless; consequently, the country abandoned its dollar in 2009 in favor of foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, to reestablish stability (Wikipedia, 2023). 

Similarly, Venezuela's de facto dollarization in recent years contributed to the resolution of its hyperinflation and the restoration of product availability (Frangie-Mawad, 2023). In these instances, the adoption of an external stable currency effectively terminated the inflationary spiral. Price stabilization occurred, and market confidence gradually returned as monetary value was restored.

However, this stability entails a significant trade-off: the surrender of independent monetary policy, effectively relinquishing a key economic management tool. Inflation frequently indicates underlying issues such as fiscal deficits or supply shocks, and conventional central bank responses include adjustments to interest rates, money supply, or exchange rates. Under a global currency regime, this flexibility would be eliminated. As analysts observe, "Monetary policy could not be enacted on a country-by-country basis... any change would have to be made at a worldwide level" (Fontinelle, 2023).

During the 2020-2022 inflation surge, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented aggressive interest rate increases to control prices. A country experiencing distinct inflationary challenges, such as Turkey or Argentina, might require different policies based on domestic conditions, but within a single global currency framework, such autonomy would be impossible. This implies that hyperinflation-prone countries would forfeit the capacity (for better or worse) to monetize deficits or devalue their currency to enhance competitiveness, as these mechanisms would be governed globally.

While this might instill discipline and prevent monetary mismanagement, it also eliminates an "escape valve" for legitimate emergencies. Governments could no longer stimulate a recessionary economy through interest rate reductions or mitigate downturn by currency depreciation, policies that, when prudently applied, can safeguard employment and income levels.

## Economic Sovereignty: Surrendering Control to a Global Authority

Money transcends its physical or digital manifestation, it symbolizes national sovereignty. Maintaining an independent currency enables control over monetary destiny: establishing interest rates, issuing debt in domestic units, and adjusting currency value to support national priorities. Adopting a single global currency would necessitate ceding substantial sovereignty to an international authority (or algorithm, if cryptocurrency-based). For major economies, this prospect is concerning; for smaller or developing countries, it can be alarming. They fear becoming policy recipients rather than policy formulators, their economic fate determined by decisions made in distant locations by institutions where they exercise limited influence (CurrencyTransfer, 2023).

Under a global currency regime, national central banks would likely cease operations or become significantly subordinated to a Global Central Bank. This global institution would issue the currency and establish a unified monetary policy. Smaller nations in particular could find themselves "surrendering a lot of their sovereignty" (CurrencyTransfer, 2023). Interest rates, money supply, lender-of-last-resort functions, all would be beyond local control.

A country experiencing high unemployment could no longer stimulate its economy through interest rate reductions or monetary expansion; it would await action from the global authority (which might never materialize if other regions are prospering). Similarly, if a speculative bubble or banking crisis affects a specific country, that government could not create additional money to support its financial institutions, it would depend on the global bank's policies or emergency assistance.

## Global Inequality: Leveling the Field or Tilting it Further?

A critical question concerns who would truly benefit from a universal currency, and who might be adversely affected. Would it narrow disparities between wealthy and developing nations, or exacerbate them? The answer is multifaceted, as a global currency would create both winners and losers through different mechanisms.

Optimistically, a single currency could eliminate structural disadvantages that affect poorer countries. "Developing nations would benefit from a stable currency and the removal of currency barriers, leading to increased trade" and investment (Fontinelle, 2023). Currently, investors often avoid African or Latin American countries partly due to currency risk, fearing that sudden devaluation will diminish their returns. If all countries utilized the same currency, that risk would be eliminated.

However, the disadvantage is that uniform monetary policy can have asymmetric impacts, often disadvantaging weaker economies. Policies appropriate for wealthy, industrialized nations might be excessively restrictive or unsuitable for developing ones, yet under a global currency, these one-size-fits-all decisions would apply universally (Fontinelle, 2023).

## Implementation Challenges: Politics, Practicality, and Technology

Even if the economic advantages and disadvantages were resolved, the logistical and political obstacles to a single global currency remain formidable. Conceptualizing a world currency differs significantly from implementing it across approximately 200 nations with vastly different systems. Several major challenges exist:

### Political Will and Governance
Achieving universal consensus on a common currency would be unprecedented. Sovereign nations carefully protect their monetary policy autonomy. Political resistance to surrendering national currency would be substantial, particularly among major powers. Establishing a global central bank or monetary authority that every country trusts represents a considerable challenge.

### Economic Diversity
The world's economies exhibit extraordinary heterogeneity, from industrial powers to agriculture-based economies, from high-income consumer markets to low-income subsistence regions. Imposing one currency and monetary policy over such diversity encounters the "Optimum Currency Area" problem.

### Infrastructure and Technology
Technically, how would a global currency be implemented and utilized? Two broad approaches exist: physical or digital (or a combination). A physical global currency (banknotes and coins used worldwide) would face immense logistical challenges.

## Lessons from Shared Currency Models: The Euro and Beyond

While a true single global currency has never existed, valuable insights can be derived from smaller-scale monetary unions and arrangements. The Eurozone represents the most prominent example of multiple countries sharing a currency, and its successes and challenges offer insights into what a world currency might entail.

### The Eurozone Experience
Launched in 1999 (book currency) and 2002 (physical notes), the euro initially united 12, now 20 European countries under one currency and the European Central Bank (ECB). On multiple fronts, the euro delivered its promised benefits: eliminating exchange rate risk among member states, enhancing intra-European trade and investment, and maintaining inflation at low levels for over a decade (Fontinelle, 2023).

However, the Eurozone debt crisis of 2010-2012 exposed the disadvantages. When the global financial crisis occurred, countries like Greece, Spain, and Portugal, which had lost export competitiveness and accumulated debt, could not devalue their currencies or independently implement accommodative monetary policy.

## Crypto as a Decentralized Global Currency: Promise or Hyperbole?

Any contemporary discussion of a global currency must address cryptocurrencies. According to Efremenko et al. (2018), "the world monetary system is in the process of transition to a new level of development under the influence of the process of financial globalization, economic integration, as well as the activation of electronic currencies turnover."

Cryptocurrency began as an experimental technology but has evolved into a significant financial phenomenon, with proponents arguing it could establish the foundation for a decentralized global monetary system beyond any single country's control.

### The Case for Crypto as a Global Currency
By design, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are borderless, a Bitcoin in Nigeria equals a Bitcoin in Brazil or Japan. Transactions occur on a global network operating continuously regardless of national holidays or capital controls. This makes cryptocurrency attractive in regions where local currency is unstable or global financial access is restricted.

Evidence indicates individuals in high-inflation countries utilizing crypto to preserve their wealth. "Many Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value," noted one economist (BBC News, 2019).

### Challenges and Limitations
Despite these advantages, current cryptocurrencies face significant obstacles before functioning as stable global currency. First, volatility: major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum experience substantial price fluctuations relative to goods (and fiat currency), one month increasing 50%, the next decreasing 30%.

Second, there's the matter of adoption and legal tender status. For true currency functionality, cryptocurrency must achieve widespread acceptance for goods and debts. Some countries have initiated experiments, El Salvador notably adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, requiring merchants to accept it.

## Conclusion

The single global currency question compels us to examine what we prioritize in a monetary system, stability and simplicity versus flexibility and national autonomy. For countries experiencing hyperinflation or exchange rate volatility, a world currency's appeal is comprehensible: it promises to eliminate worthless currency problems and facilitate participation in the stable global marketplace.

However, this stability entails significant conditions. Whether through a formal global currency or informally via dollarization, countries essentially link their economic fate to broader forces and frequently to wealthier economies' priorities. The Eurozone demonstrated that without mechanisms addressing regional disparities, a shared currency can strain cohesion and impose hardship on less economically prepared members (Fontinelle, 2023).

Whether a single global currency would benefit or harm humanity depends on its design and governance structure. With enlightened policies, it could foster unprecedented monetary stability and unity, helping control inflation in troubled economies and simplifying trade. Poorly designed or governed, it could reinforce power imbalances, leaving smaller economies without representation and vulnerable.
